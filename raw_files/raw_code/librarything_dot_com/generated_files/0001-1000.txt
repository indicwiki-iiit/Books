The haunting short story, Leaf by Niggle, recounts the story of the artist, Niggle, who has 'a long journey to make' and is seen as an allegory of Tolkien's life. The poem Mythopoeia relates an argument between two unforgettable characters as they discuss the making of myths.

Douglas Coupland, the author whom Tom Wolfe calls "one of the freshest, most exciting voices of the novel today," delivers his tenth book in ten years of writing, with "All Families Are Psychotic." Coupland recently has been compared to Jack Kerouac and F. Scott Fitzgerald, yet he is a man firmly grounded in the current era. The novel is a sizzling and sharp-witted entertainment that resounds with eternal human yearnings. In the opening pages, 65-year-old Janet Drummond checks the clock in her cheap motel room near Cape Canaveral, takes her prescription pills and does a rapid tally of the whereabouts of her three children: Wade, the eldest, in and out of jail and still radiating "the glint"; suicidal Bryan, whose girlfriend, the vowel-free Shw, is pregnant; and Sarah, the family\'s shining light, an astronaut preparing to be launched into space as the star of a shuttle mission. They will all arrive in Orlando today - along with Janet\'s ex-husband Ted and his new trophy wife - setting the stage for the most disastrous family reunion in the history of fiction. Florida may never recover from their version of fun in the sun. The last time the family got together, there was gunplay and an ensuing series of HIV infections. Now, what should be a celebration turns instead into a series of mishaps and complications that place the family members in constant peril. When the reformed Wade attempts to help his dad out of a financial jam and pay off his own bills at the fertility clinic, his plan spins quickly out of control. Adultery, hostage-taking, a letter purloined from Princess Diana\'s coffin, heart attacks at Disney World, bankruptcy, addiction and black-market negotiations - Coupland piles on one deft, comic plot twist after another, leaving you reaching for your seat belt. When the crash comes, it is surprisingly sweet. Janet contemplates her family, and where it all went wrong. "People are pretty forgiving when it comes to other people\'s family. The only family that ever horrifies you is your own." During the writing, Coupland described the book as being about "the horrible things that families do to each other and how it makes them strong." He commented: "Families who are really good to each other, I\'ve noticed, tend to dissipate, so I wonder how awful a family would have to be to stick together." Coupland\'s first novel, "Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture," became a cultural phenomenon, affixing a buzzword and a vocabulary to a generation and going on to sell over a million copies. The novels that followed were all bestsellers, and his work has continued to show a fascination with the digital, brand-conscious, media-dense culture of contemporary North American society, leading some to peg him as "an up-to-the-minute cultural reference engine." Meanwhile, his deeper interests in how human beings function in this spiritual vacuum have become increasingly apparent. For example, the character Wade contemplates his father: "What "would" the world have to offer Ted Drummond, and the men like him, a man whose usefulness to the culture had vanished somewhere around the time of Windows 95? Golf? Gold? Twenty-four hour stock readouts?" Janet, on the other hand, nears a kind of peace with life: "Time erases both the best and the worst of us."

thought. The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Well Holmes, Jr., future associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea -- an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea. Holmes, James, and Peirce all believed that ideas are not things "out there" waiting to be discovered but are tools people invent -- like knives and forks and microchips -- to make their way in the world. They thought that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals -- that ideas are social. They do not develop according to some inner logic of their own but are entirely depend -- like germs -- on their human carriers and environment. And they thought that the survival of any idea not on its immutability but on its adaptability. The Metaphysical Club is written in the spirit of this idea about ideas. It is not a history of philosophy but an absorbing narrative about personalities and social history, a story about America. It begins with the Civil War and s in 1919 with Justice Holmes\'s dissenting opinion in the case of U.S. v. Abrams-the basis for the constitutional law of free speech. The first four sections of the book focus on Holmes, James, Peirce, and their intellectual heir, John Dewey. The last section discusses some of the fundamental twentieth-century ideas they are associated with. This is a book about a way of thinking that changed American life.… (more)', 'characters': ['Charles Sanders Peirce', 'Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.', 'William James', 'John Dewey', 'Louis Agassiz'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Pulitzer Prize (2002.3|History, 2002)', 'New York Times Best Books of the Year (2001)', 'Francis Parkman Prize (2002)', 'Heartland Prize (Non-Fiction, 2001)', 'Christian Science Monitor Best Book (2001)', 'Longman/History Today Book of the Year Shortlist (2003)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist (History, 2001)', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)', 'The Economist Best Books (2001.4)']}, '9780007127740': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2972', 'Members': '7,504', 'Reviews': '119', 'Popularity': '882', 'Average rating': '(3.99)', 'Mentions': '222', 'summary': "Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man is a kaleidoscopic blending of magic, imagination, and truth, widely believed to be one of the grand master's premier accomplishments.

While psychedelics of all sorts are demonized in America today, the visionary compounds found in plants are the spiritual sacraments of tribal cultures around the world. From the iboga of the Bwiti in Gabon, to the Mazatecs of Mexico, these plants are sacred because they awaken the mind to other levels of awareness--to a holographic vision of the universe. Breaking Open the Head is a passionate, multilayered, and sometimes rashly personal inquiry into this deep division. On one level, Daniel Pinchbeck tells the story of the encounters between the modern consciousness of the West and these sacramental substances, including such thinkers as Allen Ginsberg, Antonin Artaud, Walter Benjamin, and Terence McKenna, and a new underground of present-day ethnobotanists, chemists, psychonauts, and philosophers. It is also a scrupulous recording of the author's wide-ranging investigation with these outlaw compounds, including a thirty-hour tribal initiation in West Africa; an all-night encounter with the master shamans of the South American rain forest; and a report from a psychedelic utopia in the Black Rock Desert that is the Burning Man Festival. Breaking Open the Head is brave participatory journalism at its best, a vivid account of psychic and intellectual experiences that opened doors in the wall of Western rationalism and completed Daniel Pinchbeck's personal transformation from a jaded Manhattan journalist to shamanic initiate and grateful citizen of the cosmos.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780007149827': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/83916', 'Members': '9,346', 'Reviews': '398', 'Popularity': '593', 'Average rating': '(3.8)', 'Mentions': '579', 'summary': 'In a world in which Alaska, rather than Israel, has become the homeland for the Jews following World War II, Detective Meyer Landsman and his half-Tlingit partner Berko investigate the death of a heroin-addled chess prodigy.', 'characters': ['Meyer Landsman', 'Berko Shemets', 'Alter Litvak', 'Hertz Shemets', 'Bina Gelbfish', 'Aryeh Baronshteyn', 'Laurie Jo Bear', 'Dennis Brennan', 'Rudolph Buchbinder', 'Cashdollar', 'Wilfred Dick', 'Moish Fligler', 'Frum', 'Melekh Gaystick', 'Gold', 'Naomi Landsman', 'Max Roboy', 'Shprintzl Rudashevsky', 'Ester-Malke Shemets', 'Batsheva Shpilman', 'Heskel Shpilman', 'Mendel Shpilman', 'Spade', 'Katherine Sweeney', 'Tenenboym', 'Turteltoyb', 'Micky Vayner', 'Itzik Zimbalist'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 2007)', 'New York Times Notable Book of the Year (Fiction & Poetry, 2007)', 'Edgar Award Nominee (Novel, 2008)', 'Nebula (Novel, 2007)', 'British Science Fiction Association Award Shortlist (2007.1|Novel, 2007)', "SF Site Editor's Choice (2007)", 'Hugo (Novel, 2008)', 'Locus (2008.1|SF Novel, 2008)', 'Sidewise Award (Long Form, 2007)', 'John W.

Enthralling.' Peter Ackroyd, The Times The original transcript of the famous Wilde vs Queensberry trial, containing previously unseen details and exchanges. With extensive footnotes and a new introduction, this definitive account is a dramatic read that will delight Wilde enthusiasts and the general reader. One of the most famous love affairs in literary history is that of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas. When it became public, it cost Wilde everything. Merlin Holland has discovered the original courtroom transcript of the trial which led to his grandfather's tragedy. Here at last is the true record, without the distortions of previous accounts. On 18 February 1895 Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, delivered a note to the Albemarle Club addressed to 'Oscar Wilde posing as somdomite [sic]'. With Bosie's encouragement, Wilde decided to sue the Marquess for libel. As soon as the trial opened London's literary darling was at the centre of the greatest scandal of his time. Wilde's fall from grace was swift: his case lost, prosecution by the Crown soon followed, ending in the imprisonment that destroyed his health - even as his art, as Wilde put it, improved through 'suffering'. In this remarkable book we witness Wilde's confidence ebbing under the relentless questioning and see him lose track of the witty lines for which he was famous. Ultimately, it was his wit that betrayed him.… (more)", 'characters': ['Oscar Wilde', 'Lord Alfred Douglas'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780007158515': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/73092', 'Members': '3,617', 'Reviews': '47', 'Popularity': '2,580', 'Average rating': '(4.02)', 'Mentions': '15', 'summary': 'The Cat in the Hat takes Young Cat in tow to show him the fun he can get out of reading.', 'characters': ['The Cat in the Hat', 'Jake the Pillow Snake', 'Foo-Foo the Snoo'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780007158522': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/22982', 'Members': '9,174', 'Reviews': '360', 'Popularity': '614', 'Average rating': '(4.35)', 'Mentions': '61', 'summary': 'Advice in rhyme for proceeding in life; weathering fear, loneliness, and confusion; and being in charge of your actions.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 1990)', "1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up (2009.0333|2009, Ages 5↑)", 'NCTE Adventuring with Books: A Booklist for Pre-K—Grade 6 (1993|10th Edition: 1988-1992)']}, '9780007162994': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/106832', 'Members': '1,195', 'Reviews': '24', 'Popularity': '12,081', 'Average rating': '(3.84)', 'Mentions': '37', 'summary': "O'Brien's searing memoir of his years as a soldier in Vietnam takes readers with him through the ghostly ambiguities of manhood and morality in a war gone terribly wrong.", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['ALA Best Books for Young Adults (1973)']}, '9780007171996': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1386651', 'Members': '43,821', 'Reviews': '423', 'Popularity': '23', 'Average rating': '(4.52)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '2 / 1318', 'summary': "One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, The Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages, it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. From his fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, Sauron's power spread far and wide. He gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. On Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday, he disapeared, bequeathing to his young cousin, Frodo, the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. THE LORD OF THE RINGS tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of

and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.… (more)', 'characters': ['Morgoth Bauglir', 'Fëanor', 'Túrin Turambar', 'Beren', 'Lúthien Tinúviel', 'Ar-Adûnakhôr', 'Aegnor', 'Aerandir', 'Aerin (kinswoman of Húrin)', 'Amandil', 'Amarië', 'Amlach', 'Amras', 'Amrod', 'Anárion', 'Ancalagon', 'Angrim', 'Angrod', 'Annael', 'Aragorn II', 'Dior Eluchíl', 'Aranwë', 'Aratan', 'Aratar', 'Arathorn', 'Aredhel Ar-Feiniel', 'Ar-Gimilzôr', 'Arien', 'Ar-Pharazôn the Golden', 'Ar-Sakalthôr', 'Arthad', 'Aulë', 'Azaghâl', 'Baragund', 'Barahir', 'Baran', 'Beleg', 'Belegund', 'Bëor', 'Bereg', 'Bór', 'Borlach', 'Borlad', 'Boromir (first lord of Ladros)', 'Boron', 'Borthand', 'Brandir', 'Bregolas', 'Bregor', 'Brodda', 'Caranthir', 'Carcharoth', 'Celeborn', 'Celebrimbor', 'Celegorm', 'Círdan', 'Ciryon', 'Curufin', 'Daeron', 'Dagnir', 'Dairuin', 'Denethor (First Age)', 'Dior', 'Dorlas', 'Draugluin', 'Durin', 'Eärendil', 'Eärendur (lord of Andúnië)', 'Eärendur (10th King of Arnor)', 'Eärnil', 'Eärnur', 'Eärwen', 'Ecthelion', 'Edrahil', 'Eilinel', 'Varda Elentári', 'Elemmírë', 'Elendil', 'Elendur', 'Elenwë', 'Elrond Half-elven', 'Elros', 'Eluréd', 'Elurin', 'Elwë', 'Elwing', 'Emeldir', 'Eöl', 'Eönwë', 'Erellont', 'Eru', 'Estë', 'Falathar', 'Finarfin', 'Finduilas', 'Fingolfin', 'Fingon', 'Finrod Felagund', 'Finwë', 'Frodo Baggins', 'Fuinur', 'Galadriel', 'Galdor the Tall', 'Gandalf', 'Gelmir (Elf of Nargothrond)', 'Gelmir (Elf of Angrod)', 'Gildor Inglorion', 'Gimilkhâd', 'Glaurung', 'Glirhuin', 'Glóredhel', 'Glorfindel', 'Gorlim', 'Gothmog', 'Guilin', 'Gundor', 'Gwindor', 'Hador', 'Haldad', 'Haldan', 'Haldar', 'Haldir (First Age)', 'Haleth', 'Halmir', 'Handir', 'Hareth', 'Hathaldir', 'Hathol', 'Herumor', 'Huan', 'Hunthor', 'Huor', 'Húrin', 'Ibun', 'Idril', 'Ilmarë', 'Ilúvatar', 'Imlach', 'Indis', 'Ingwë', 'Inziladûn', 'Inzilbêth', 'Irmo', 'Isildur', 'Khîm', 'Lalaith', 'Lenwë', 'Lindórië', 'Lorgan', 'Mablung', 'Maedhros', 'Maeglin', 'Maglor', 'Magor', 'Mahtan', 'Malach', 'Manwë', 'Marach', 'Mardil Voronwë', 'Melian', 'Meneldil', 'Mîm', 'Míriel (Daughter of Tar-Palantir)', 'Míriel (first wife of Finwë)', 'Morwen [Tolkein]', 'Nahar', 'Námo', 'Nerdanel', 'Nessa [Tolkein]', 'Nienna [Tolkein]', 'Nienor [Tolkein]', 'Nimloth', 'Ohtar', 'Olórin', 'Olwë', 'Orodreth', 'Oromë', 'Ossë', 'Radagast the Brown', 'Radhruin', 'Ragnor [The Lord Of The Rings]', 'Rían', 'Rochallor', 'Rúmil of Tirion', 'Saeros', 'Salmar', 'Saruman the White', 'Sauron', 'Silmarien', 'Tar-Ancalimon', 'Tar-Atanamir', 'Tar-Elendil', 'Tar-Ciryatan', 'Tar-Minastir', 'Tar-Palantir', 'Telchar', 'Telemnar', 'Elu Thingol', 'Thorondor', 'Thranduil', 'Thuringwethil', 'Tilion', 'Tulkas', 'Tuor', 'Turgon', 'Túrin I', 'Uinen', 'Uldor', 'Ulfang', 'Ulfast', 'Ulmo', 'Ulwarth', 'Ungoliant', 'Urthel', 'Vairë', 'Valandil of Andúnië', 'Vána', 'Varda', 'Voronwë', 'Yavanna', 'Gildor (First Age)', 'Túrin II', 'Amroth'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Ditmar Award (International Fiction, 1978)', 'Gandalf Award (Book-length Fantasy, 1978)', 'Locus (1978.2|Fantasy Novel, 1978)', 'New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 1977)', 'Gigamesh (Fantasía, Novela, 1985)', 'Locus (Best Fantasy Novel, 1978)', 'ISFDB Top 100 Books -

Waking up in an L.A. hospital, John Johnson is amazed that it was the flu and not an overdose of five different drugs mixed with cognac that nearly killed him. As a producer of high-adrenaline action flicks, he\'s led a decadent and dangerous life, purchasing his way through every conceivable variant of sex. But each variation seems to take him one notch away from a capacity for love, and while movie-making was once a way for him to create worlds of sensation, it now bores him. After his near-death experience, John decides to walk away from his life. Susan Colgate is an unbankable former tv star and child beauty pageant contender. Forced to marry a heavy metal singer in need of a Green Card after her parents squander her sitcom earnings, she becomes the alpha road rat. But when the band\'s popularity dwindles, the marriage dissolves. Flying back to Los Angeles in Economy, Susan\'s plane crashes and only she survives. As she walks away from the disaster virtually unscathed, Susan, too, decides to disappear.

As Americans, we assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression. In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice--the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish--becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice--from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse. By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counter intuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['Business Week Top Ten Books of the Year', 'forbes.com Top Ten Books of the Year']}, '9780060009427': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/29255', 'Members': '3,491', 'Reviews': '79', 'Popularity': '2,702', 'Average rating': '(3.88)', 'Mentions': '145', 'summary': "What does it mean when a fictional hero takes a journey?.

The author of nine bestsellers--including the history-making Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus--John Gray expands on the expert advice touched upon in his previous books and distills each message into a powerful, inspiring daily meditation in this newest volume. There's no doubt about it: The relationship between men and women is extremely complex. We often forget just how different the sexes are, and become frustrated and confused by a loved one's behavior. Every day we need to be reminded of these differences and realize that it's okay to be different as long as we recognize and understand the behavior of the opposite sex. In Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days, John Gray provides us with daily inspirations that lovingly and insightfully remind us of the contrasts between Mars and Venus, allowing us to solve conflicts in our relationships. Each month is devoted to a single theme, with the daily meditations enlarging on the particular subject at hand. The topics correlate with the very traits of the month itself: January, an exhilarating time of new beginnings, inspires resolve and the desire to excel. In February, when we find ourselves deep in winter's grip and challenged by constant emotional upheaval, we seek reminders of the importance of commitment and the need for patience. May concentrates on such springtime issues as harmony and appreciation. The topics discussed are as diverse as relationships are. Inside you'll find comforting and helpful advice on: The true meaning of equality Improving communication Giving and receiving emotional support The awakening of our inner qualities Needing time alone Keeping the passion alive Reacting to stress Whether you need the thoughtful reminders yourself or know a friend or loved one who will benefit from these beautiful reflections, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days is a classic that no bookshelf should be without. The Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days contains 365 inspirations to remind you each day of the basic differences between men and women Women love a man with a plan; men love a woman with a smile. A woman is like a wave. When she feels loved, her self-esteem rises and falls like a wave in motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down. This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom, her mood will shift suddenly, and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically, her wave begins to rise back up...By recognizing this pattern, a man doesn't take it personally. When he doesn't feel as if he is being blamed for her downs, he can be more supportive. A rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle, which involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again...Most women are surprised to realize that even when a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer. Men instinctively feel this urge to pull away. It is not a decision or a choice. It just happens. It is neither his fault nor her fault. It is a natural cycle. Romance for women is when a man does things without her having to ask; romance for men is when a woman appreciates the things he does. Showing interest is one of the most important secrets to opening a woman's heart. A man is free to be the best he can be when he feels accepted just the way he is. Women need to work on trusting, while men need to work on caring.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060218058': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/55129', 'Members': '1,867', 'Reviews': '32', 'Popularity': '6,633', 'Average rating': '(4.18)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '1 / 23', 'summary': "With help from an eccentric professor who gives their imaginations special intensive training, three children succeed in locating the last of the great Whangdoodles and granting his heart's desire.", 'characters': ['Lindy Potter', 'Ben Potter', 'Tom Potter', 'Professor Savant', 'The Whangdoodle', 'The Prock'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Young Hoosier Book Award Nominee (1976-1977)']}, '9780060256579': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/150465', 'Members': '1,001', 'Reviews': '23', 'Popularity': '15,265', 'Average rating': '(4.27)', 'Mentions': '4', 'summary': 'A missing piece, looking for someone to carry it along, finally develops its own momentum.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060256753': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/8096', 'Members': '825', 'Reviews': '10', 'Popularity': '19,655', 'Average rating': '(4.15)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': "After leaving the jungle for the circus and a life of fame and wealth, a lion who taught himself to be the best shot in the world discovers he's not really a lion anymore, and not really a man, either.", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060277406': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2356948', 'Members': '34', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '565,226', 'Average rating': '(4.25)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'A compilation of recipes for foods served in England during the Victorian Era and inspired by characters and events in "The Secret Garden" by Frances Hodgson Burnett.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060278427': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/122402', 'Members': '216', 'Reviews': '5', 'Popularity': '95,242', 'Average rating': '(4.24)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': 'Photographs and mementos accompany an account of the life and literary career of the author of the well-loved "Little House" books.', 'characters': ['Laura Ingalls Wilder'], 'awards_and_honors': ['CCBC Choices (1998)']}, '9780060391539': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/438001', 'Members': '93', 'Reviews': '1', 'Popularity': '226,110', 'Average rating': '(3.08)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "With unflinching, often painful honesty, the sardonic, outspoken cohost of Howard Stern's nationally syndicated radio and cable TV show reveals the shocking facts of her childhood abuse.

Christian Europe, a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory, first on the battlefield and in the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of public and even private life." "In this volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed, how they had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy, education and culture. He describes how some Middle Easterners fastened blame on a series of scapegoats, both external and internal, while others asked, not "who did this to us?" but rather "where did we go wrong?" and, as a natural consequence, "how do we put it right?" Lewis highlights the striking differences between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries with thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil society, the clock and the calendar."--Jacket.… (more)', 'characters': ['Mustapha Kemal', 'Napoleon Bonaparte'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 2002)']}, '9780060518653': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/3381', 'Members': '2,445', 'Reviews': '33', 'Popularity': '4,509', 'Average rating': '(4.13)', 'Mentions': '94', 'summary': '"I have told you nothing about man that is not true."

That is, until the dead body of a female student from Heather's residence hall is discovered at the bottom of an elevator shaft.

Yet no one wants to listen, not the police, her colleagues, or the P.I. who owns the brownstone where she lives, even when more students start turning up dead in equally ordinary and subtly sinister ways. So Heather makes the decision to take on yet another new career: as spunky girl detective!

Their mission was "to proceed all the way to the end of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas" and unite the whole world in Confucian harmony. Their journey would last over two years and circle the entire globe. When they returned Zhu Di had fallen from power and China was beginning its long, self-imposed isolation from the world it had so recently embraced. The great ships rotted at their moorings and the records of their journeys were destroyed. Lost was the knowledge that Chinese ships had reached America 70 years before Columbus and circumnavigated the globe a century before Magellan.

In this historical detective story, he shares the account of his discoveries and the incontrovertible evidence to support them. His narrative brings together ancient maps, precise navigational knowledge, astronomy and the surviving accounts by Chinese explorers and the later European navigators.

For each of us, there is a connection between our early family dynamics and experiences and our current attitudes and decisions. Many of the people Dr. Laura has helped did not realize how their histories impacted their adult lives, or how their choices in people, repetitive situations, and decisions -- even their emotional reactions -- were connected to those early negative experiences, playing a major role in their current unhappiness. For these people and millions like them, too much time is dedicated to repeating the ugly dynamics of childhood in a vain attempt to repair or cope with deep hurt and longings. Too often they use their emotional pain to control others or excuse their own inappropriate and destructive behaviors. Some turn to therapy, only to find themselves trapped in their self-pitying victim mode, robbed of optimism, confidence, and growth. Dr. Laura will help you realize that no matter what circumstances you came from or currently live in, you are ultimately responsible for how you react to them. The acceptance of this basic truth is the source of your power to secure the Good Life you long for. In her signature straightforward style, with real-life examples, Dr. Laura shows you what you will gain by not being satisfied with an identity as a victim, or even as a survivor -- but striving to be a victor! In Bad Childhood -- Good Life, Dr. Laura will guide you to accept the truth of the assaults on your psyche and soul, understand your unique coping style and how it impacts your daily thoughts and actions, and help you embrace a life of more peace and happiness.

Jack Faber is one of them. The son of a struggling Louisiana sugar farmer, Faber is a young hotshot pitcher with an unhittable slider and rocket for a fastball. He plays for the fabled Seapuit Seawolves and dreams of making the Big Show, like many of his teammates: the catcher, Tony Garcia, fast-talking, irreverent prelaw student from Northwestern; Doughnut Davis, the erratic pitching phenom from the University of Georgia, who can throw a heat-seeking 93-mph screamer over the edge of the plate, followed by a 93-mph screamer over the umpire's head; the Citadel's slick officer cadet infielders, Rick Adams and Bobby Madison; the steel-armed outfielder, Ray Sweeney, son of a Maine fisherman; and the Sooner's first baseman, Zac Colbert, from Mickey Mantle's hometown of Spavinaw, Oklahoma. In the middle of it all, Jack's dad, Ben Faber, who can barely make ends meet on his bayou sugar farm, is falling in love with Garcia's mother, Natalie, the beautiful and penniless classical music teacher from the Chicago tenements. Their budding long-distance romance can hardly make it off the ground, as they can't travel and can't afford even a phone call. And their hopes for their sons are at odds: For Natalie, it is for Tony to get his act together-forget about this school yard game, go to law school and become a successful attorney. For Ben, it is for Jack to land a huge contract in the major leagues. Jack triumphantly becomes the Cape's MVP, but disaster awaits him when he returns to school in Louisiana. A new coach, the scowling Bruno Riazzi, a former pro catcher, resents the kid's celebrity status and decides he needs to knock him down a peg or two. And he'll stop at nothing to make it happen. Humiliated, Jack loses his lifelong art, and with it his passion for the game and, mysteriously, his ability to throw. His fastball has become tentative, his curve timid, and the beloved slider floats up to the plate like a volleyball. It has happened before to pros like Rick Ankiel and Mark Wohlers, brilliantly successful pitchers who suddenly lost it. A devastated Jack Faber is released from the St. Charles College roster. But the Seawolves coaches won't give up on him. They bring Jack back to Cape Marlin, determined to help him rediscover his lost talent.

A kind of vigorous supervisory humour is his natural idiom as a writer, and one particular attraction of his shorter work is the fresh further display it offers of this prime element in his literary character."… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060587031': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/45111', 'Members': '1,856', 'Reviews': '47', 'Popularity': '6,684', 'Average rating': '(4.1)', 'Mentions': '34', 'summary': 'After trading his father for two goldfish, a boy and his little sister go on a rollicking adventure around town to get him back.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ["Prix Ligue de l'Enseignement 41 pour le Jeune Public—bd BOUM (2000)", 'CCBC Choices (2005)']}, '9780060589288': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/8623', 'Members': '4,724', 'Reviews': '83', 'Popularity': '1,732', 'Average rating': '(3.53)', 'Mentions': '26', 'summary': 'After being tricked into moving to Geneva as a dancer, Maria must work as a prostitute.

Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. Drawing on his own journey from a naïve, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life--one not rooted in creed or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus's character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith.… (more)", 'characters': ['Jesus, of Nazareth "Christ"'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060609191': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/45972', 'Members': '1,081', 'Reviews': '16', 'Popularity': '13,812', 'Average rating': '(4.08)', 'Mentions': '4', 'summary': 'One of the vital challenges facing thoughtful people today is how to read the Bible faithfully without abandoning our sense of truth and history. Reading the Bible Again for the First Time provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined -- in an approach the author calls "historical-metaphorical." Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible\'s origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyone -- whatever one\'s religious background -- to engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060622138': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/65857', 'Members': '1,619', 'Reviews': '8', 'Popularity': '8,035', 'Average rating': '(4.03)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': '"More than inspirational reading: it belongs to the very heartbeat of evangelic witness." --Christianity Today \xa0 Shadow of the Almighty is one of the great missionary stories of modern times.\xa0It is the life and testament of Jim Elliot, as told by Elliot\'s widow, author and evangelist Elisabeth Elliot Gren.\xa0Shadow of the Almighty is the true account of\xa0Elliot\'s martyrdom, along with\xa0four fellow\xa0missionaries, at the hands of Ecuador\'s Huaorani Indians.\xa0About this important and enlightening book, Eugenia Price\xa0writes,"It proves that Jesus Christ will bring bright creativity out of any shadow which might fall across any life and any love."

In The Cat\'s Pajamas, this "latter-day O.

Here you will find stories strange and scary, nostalgic and bittersweet, humorous and heart-touching, ranging from the not-so-long-gone past to an unknowable future: a group of senators drinks a bit too much, and gambles away the United States; a newlywed couple buys an old house and finds their fledgling relationship tested; two mysterious strangers arrive at a rooming house and baffle their fellow occupants with strange crying in the night; a lonely woman takes a last chance on love. The final piece in the collection is a story-poem, a fond salute from Bradbury to his literary heroes Shaw, Chesterton, Dickens, Twain, Poe, Wilde, Melville, and Kipling.

She regally stalked the streets of Greenwich Village wearing a bustle with a flashing taillight, a brassiere made from tomato cans, or a birdcage necklace; declaimed her poems to sailors in beer halls; and enthusiastically modeled in the nude for artists such as Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp, setting the city ablaze with her antics. Before today's outsized celebrities, there was the Baroness -- poet and artist, proto-punk rocker, sexual libertine, fashion avatar, and troublemaker. At the center of the Dadaist circle, the Baroness transformed herself into a living, breathing work of art. Holy Skirts is a vivid imagining of the Baroness's story. Beginning in 1904, with Elsa's burlesque performance onstage in Berlin's Wintergarten cabaret, the adventures continue across Europe, through turbulent marriages and love affairs, until the Baroness finally lands in New York City, just before America enters the war. As she befriends Greenwich Village artists and writers, she defines herself as a poet, even as she breaks the bonds of female propriety. In a beautifully written novel, René Steinke paints an exquisite portrait of this woman and her time -- an era of cataclysmic change that witnessed brutal war, technological innovation, the rise of urban living, and an irrevocable shift in the lives of women, who, like Elsa, struggled to create their own destinies. Holy Skirts is a celebration of resilience and imagination, anexploration of the world in which the modern woman was born, and a testament to the lost bohemia.… (more)", 'characters': ['Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven', 'Man Rey', 'Marcel Duchamp'], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Award finalist (2005.1|Fiction, 2005)', 'Library of Virginia Literary Award finalist (Fiction, 2006)']}, '9780060782139': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2944782', 'Members': '131', 'Reviews': '1', 'Popularity': '160,829', 'Average rating': '(3.6)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "Butterflies There are 20,000 different kinds of butterflies in the world.

John "Red" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob, rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James "Whitey" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper, Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven, Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror, brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer, loan shark, money launderer, and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin, Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests, fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA. While Bulger\'s other top men turned informant to save their own hides, Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be, himself, a rat. For in the end, in a remarkable show of betrayal, Bulger turned out to be the FBI\'s "main man" and top informant -- tipping off the feds for decades while still managing to operate one of the most murderous and profitable organized crime outfits of all time. In Rat Bastards, Shea brings that mysterious world and gritty urban Irish American street culture into sharp focus by telling his own story -- of his fatherless upbringing, his apprenticeship on the tough streets of Southie, and his love affair with trouble, boxing, and then the gangster life. In prose that is refreshingly honest, personal, and surprisingly tender, Shea tells his harrowing, unflinching, and unapologetic story. A man who did the crime, did the time, and held fast to the Irish code of silence, which he was raised to follow at any cost, Shea remains a man of honor and in doing so has become a living legend. One of the last of a dying breed, a true stand-up guy. Shea expects no forgiveness and makes no excuses for the life he chose. His story is intense, compelling, and in your face.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060837334': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/473911', 'Members': '257', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '78,835', 'Average rating': '(3.78)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': "After 35 years in power, Henry VIII was a bloated, hideously obese, black-humoured old man, rarely seen in public.

It was increasingly obvious that when Henry died, real power in England would be exercised by a regent. The prospect of that prize spurred the rival court factions into deadly conflict.

"The legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa - the name has since become a byword for a cataclysmic disaster - was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. Beyond the purely physical horrors of an event that has only very recently been properly understood, the eruption changed the world in more ways than could possibly be imagined. Dust swirled round the planet for years, causing temperatures to plummet and sunsets to turn vivid with lurid and unsettling displays of light. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogota and Washington, D. C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island\'s destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away.

But hidden within the rituals of its creation is a fascinating and mysterious story - a story of two remarkable men whose strange twenty-year relationship lies at the core of this historic undertaking. Professor James Murray, an astonishingly learned former schoolmaster and bank clerk, was the distinguished editor of the OED project. Dr. William Chester Minor, an American surgeon from New Haven, Connecticut, who had served in the Civil War, was one of thousands of contributors who submitted illustrative quotations of words to be used in the dictionary. But Minor was no ordinary contributor. He was remarkably prolific, sending thousands of neat, handwritten quotations from his home in the small village of Crowthorne, fifty miles from Oxford. On numerous occasions Murray invited Minor to visit Oxford and celebrate his work, but Murray's offer was regularly - and mysteriously - refused. Thus the two men, for two decades, maintained a close relationship only through correspondence. Finally, in 1896, after Minor had sent nearly ten thousand definitions to the dictionary but had still never traveled from his home, a puzzled Murray set out to visit him. It was then that Murray finally learned the truth about Minor - that, in addition to being a masterful wordsmith, Minor was also a murderer, clinically insane - and locked up in Broadmoor, England's harshest asylum for criminal lunatics.… (more)", 'characters': ['William Chester Minor', 'James Murray (Sir)'], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (General Nonfiction, 1998)', 'New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 1998)', 'Salon Book Award (Nonfiction, 1998)']}, '9780060840884': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/876898', 'Members': '540', 'Reviews': '18', 'Popularity': '33,363', 'Average rating': '(3.79)', 'Mentions': '22', 'summary': 'John Keller is everyone\'s favorite hit man.

Impeccably researched, filled with page-turning romance, passion, and scandal, Sex with the Queen explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers. She was the queen, living in an opulent palace, wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied, admired, and revered. She was also miserable, having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen, a royal ogre who was sadistic, foaming at the mouth, physically repulsive, mentally incompetent, or sexually impotent--and in some cases all of the above. How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone--swashbuckling generals, polished courtiers, and virile cardinals--many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered, and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen, who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs, which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover, anything could happen--from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen's lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair's implications in terms of power, money, and factional rivalry. At European courts, it was the politics--not the sex--that caused a royal woman's tragedy--or her ultimate triumph.… (more)", 'characters': ['Sophia Dorothea of Celle', 'Katherine Howard (Catherine Howard)', 'Diana, Princess of Wales', 'Marie Antoinette'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060850524': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1977', 'Members': '45,941', 'Reviews': '648', 'Popularity': '20', 'Average rating': '(3.95)', 'Mentions': '1236', 'summary': "Huxley's classic prophetic novel describes the socialized horrors of a futuristic utopia devoid of individual freedom.", 'characters': ['Bernard Marx', 'Lenina Crowne', 'John the Savage', 'Mustapha Mond', 'Helmholtz Watson', 'Henry Foster'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Waterstones Books of the Century (1997, No 15)', "BBC's Big Read (Best loved novel, 2003, No 87)", "The Modern Library's 100 Best Novels: The Board's List (5)", "The Modern Library's 100 Best Novels: The Reader's List (18)", 'Radcliffe Publishing Course Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century (16)', "The Observer's 100 Greatest Novels of All Time (53)", "Larry McCaffery's 20th Century Greatest Hits (44)", '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006/2008/2010/2012 Edition)', 'Guardian 1000 (Science Fiction & Fantasy)', 'ALA 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000 (52)', "The Telegraph's 110 Best Books: The Perfect Library (2008)", "Newsweek's Top 100 Books: The Meta-List (2009, No. 23)", 'ALA 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-1999 (54)', 'ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (1999.5|Fiction, 1999)', 'Arkham Sampler 1949 Survey by August Derleth (2)', 'Astounding/Analog Science Fiction and Fact 1952 All-Time Poll (22)', 'Astounding/Analog Science Fiction and Fact 1956 All-Time Poll (15)', "New York Public Library's Books of the Century (09|Utopias & Dystopias)", 'thisrecording.com 100 Greatest Science Fiction or Fantasy Novels of All Time (7)', 'Prometheus Award nominee (Hall of Fame Award for Best Classic Libertarian SF Novel, 1983)', "Cyril Connolly's 100 Key Books of the Modern Movement (1932)", '501 Must-Read Books (Science Fiction)', 'Classics of Science Fiction (20)', "The Essential Man's Library: 100 Must-Read Books", "Bloomsbury's 100 Must-Read Science Fiction Novels", "Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century (21)", 'Easton Press: The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written (10)', "Daily Telegraph's 100 Books of the Century, 1900-1999", 'AbeBooks: 50 Essential Science Fiction Books', 'From Zero to Well-Read in 100 Books (B)', "Christianity Today's Books of the Century", "The Observer's 100 Best Novels (56)", 'Геном русской души (37)', "NPR's Top 100 Science-Fiction, Fantasy Books (9)", '100 лучших книг по версии Дистопии (8)', 'ALA 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000-2009 (36)', '1000 лучших произведений мировой худ. литературы в русских переводах, рекомендованных для комплектования школьной библиотеки', '1001 böcker du måste läsa innan du dör', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)', 'Les 100 livres préférés des Français (26)', 'The New Lifetime Reading Plan With Going Further (117)', '100 Books That Shaped World History', 'Harenberg Buch der 1000 Bücher', 'Greatest Books algorithm (#72)']}, '9780060851989': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/970957', 'Members': '1,849', 'Reviews': '62', 'Popularity': '6,727', 'Average rating': '(3.61)', 'Mentions': '45', 'summary': "Lizzie Nichols has a problem, she can't keep her mouth shut.

Myth One: that Europe\'s leap forward occurred suddenly in the "Renaissance," following centuries of medieval stagnation. Not so, say the Gieses: Early modern technology and experimental science were direct outgrowths of the decisive innovations of medieval Europe, in the tools and techniques of agriculture, craft industry, metallurgy, building construction, navigation, and war. Myth Two: that Europe achieved its primacy through "Western" superiority. On the contrary, the authors report, many of Europe\'s most important inventions - the horse harness, the stirrup, the magnetic compass, cotton and silk cultivation and manufacture, papermaking, firearms, "Arabic" numerals - had their origins outside Europe, in China, India, and Islam. The Gieses show how Europe synthesized its own innovations - the three-field system, water power in industry, the full-rigged ship, the putting-out system - into a powerful new combination of technology, economics, and politics. From the expansion of medieval man\'s capabilities, the voyage of Columbus with all its fateful consequences is seen as an inevitable product, while even the genius of Leonardo da Vinci emerges from the context of earlier and lesser-known dreamers and tinkerers.

Disconcerted and enchanted, the reader follows the narrator of Slowness through a midsummer\'s night in which two tales of seduction, separated by more than two hundred years, interweave and oscillate between the sublime and the comic. In the eighteenth-century narrative, the marvelous Madame de T. summons a young nobleman to her chateau one evening and gives him an unforgettable lesson in the art of seduction and the pleasures of love.In the same chateau at the end of the twentieth century, a hapless young intellectual experiences a rather less successful night. Distracted by his desire to be the center of public attention at a convention of entomologists, Vincent loses the beautiful Julie - ready and willing though she is to share an evening of intimacy and sexual pleasure with him - and suffers the ridicule of his peers. A "morning-after" encounter between the two young men from different centuries brings the novel to a poignant close: Vincent has already obliterated the memory of his humiliation as he prepares to speed back to Paris on his motorcycle, while the young nobleman will lie back on the cushions of his carriage and relive the night before in the lingering pleasure of memory.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['70 лучших французских романов XX века по версии "Эксмо"']}, '9780060929596': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/5223', 'Members': '1,083', 'Reviews': '31', 'Popularity': '13,775', 'Average rating': '(3.88)', 'Mentions': '34', 'summary': "In 1967, after a twin baby boy suffered a botched circumcision, his family agreed to a radical treatment that would alter his gender.

In this unforgettable story, the secret fundamentals of golf, friendship, competition, and the inscrutable relationships between fathers and sons all combine to form an extraordinary tale. Bobby Jobe is a gifted golfer whose swing is much better than his attitude. Leading a major tournament in the final round, he gets distracted as usual -- and chokes, blowing his lead. Also as usual, he blames his caddy, Greyhound Mote, who stomps off the course: Greyhound is loyal, but Bobby's gone just one insult too far. Shortly thereafter, as he's leaving the golf club, Greyhound spots Bobby obsessively practicing the shot that earlier lost him the tournament. Overhead, the clouds of an approaching thunderstorm roil, and as Greyhound watches, lightning strikes -- and both of their lives are changed forever. Months later Greyhound has retreated to his small hometown, where he helps his mother run a shabby but proud nine-hole golf course. All he knows of Bobby since their last bitter farewell in a hospital room is that he has been permanently blinded. What he doesn't know is that an extraordinary woman has come into Bobby's life, determined to save him by convincing him he can still play competitive golf. And she believes that Greyhound is the person to help him do it.

Jay Parini paints an intimate picture of Faulkner\'s Mississippi world and shows how the artist transformed this raw material into Yoknapatawpha County, a place of pure imagination." "Between 1928 and 1942, during what Faulkner called his "one matchless time," a period of wild inspiration when characters and stories came to him mysteriously and in abundance, he published more than half a dozen masterpieces, including the novels The Sound and the Fury; As I Lay Dying; Sanctuary; Light in August; Absalom, Absalom!; The Wild Palms; Go Down, Moses; and The Hamlet. This is an astonishing achievement without equal in American literature." "Parini, who has taught Faulkner\'s work to students for nearly thirty years, brings to life this writer\'s complex fictional world in the context of his life, using the one to illuminate the other. He uses letters and memoirs unavailable to earlier biographers as well as interviews he had with Faulkner\'s daughter and several of his lovers.

Will human genetic engineering become commonplace? Will human cloning ever be safe? Are there many universes? How much will the climate change during the coming century? The Best American Science Writing 2002 gathers top writers and scientists covering the latest developments in the fastest-changing, farthest-reaching scientific fields, such as medicine, genetics, computer technology, evolutionary psychology, cutting-edge physics, and the environment. Among this year\'s selections: In "The Made-to-Order Savior," Lisa Belkin spotlights two desperate families seeking an unprecedented cure by a medically and ethically unprecedented means -- creating a genetically matched child. Margaret Talbot\'s "A Desire to Duplicate" reveals that the first human clone may very likely come from an entirely unexpected source, and sooner than we think. Michael Specter reports on the shock waves rippling through the field of neuroscience following the revolutionary discovery that adult brain cells might in fact regenerate ("Rethinking the Brain"). Christopher Dickey\'s "I Love My Glow Bunny" recounts with sly humor a peculiar episode in which genetic engineering and artistic culture collide. Natalie Angier draws an insightful contrast between suicide terrorists and rescue workers who risk their lives, and finds that sympathy and altruism have a definite place in the evolution of human nature, David Berlinski\'s "What Brings a World into Being?" ponders the idea of biology and physics as essentially digital technologies, exploring the mysteries encoded in the universe\'s smallest units, be they cells or quanta. Nicholas Wade shows how one of the most controversial books of the year, The Skeptical Environmentalist, by former Greenpeace member and self-described leftist Bjorn Lomborg, debunks some of the most cherished tenets of the environmental movement, suggesting that things are perhaps not as bad as we\'ve been led to believe. And as a counterpoint, Darcy Frey\'s profile of George Divoky reveals a dedicated researcher whose love of birds and mystery leads to some sobering discoveries about global warming and forcefully reminds us of the unsung heroes of science: those who put in long hours, fill in small details, and take great trouble. In the end, the unanswered questions are what sustain scientific inquiry, open new frontiers of knowledge, and lead to new technologies and medical treatments.

O'Donohue opens our eyes, hearts and minds to the wonder of our own relationship with beauty. Rather than 'covering' this theme, he uncovers it, exposing the infinity and mystery of its breadth. His words return us home to the dignity of silence, the profundity of stillness, the power of thought and perception, and the eternal grace and generosity of beauty's presence. In this masterful and revelatory work, O'Donohue encourages our greater intimacy with beauty, and celebrates it for what it really is- a homecoming of the human spirit.As he focuses on the classical, medieval and Celtic traditions, on art, music, literature, nature and language, O'Donohue reveals how beauty's invisible embrace invites us towards new heights of passion and creativity.DIVINE BEAUTY is an exquisite treasury of Forms of the Beautiful.

The father, Nelson O'Brien, is an enterprising Irish immigrant who travels to Cuba as a photographer during the Spanish-American War in 1898, and there he meets his future wife, the sensitive, aristocratic, poetic Mariela Montez. As they are enroute to America in 1902, their first daughter, Margarita, whose reminiscences inform much of this novel's narrative, is born at sea. The Montez O'Briens settle in a small Pennsylvania town, where Nelson practices his photography trade and runs the Jewel Box Movie Theater, and Mariela gives birth to thirteen more daughters and then, finally, a son. As Margarita looks back on her long and full life, the novel recounts the lives, loves, and tragedies of the Montez O'Briens and their always complex relations with one another. It also follows Emilio through his days in Greenwich Village, the army, and Hollywood, where, as Monty O'Brien, he stars in grade-B detective and Tarzan movies and pals around with screen idols like Errol Flynn. Never altogether at peace in the overwhelming feminine world of his family, he searches restlessly for an elusive true love. And after an unhappy early marriage, Margarita herself finds the deepest passion of her life in extreme old age. The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien is a raucous and heartfelt epic that spans both the continent and our century, a celebration of the moments of earthly happiness that give meaning to diverse yet deeply interrelated existences and of the constantly surprising, regenerating life force that keeps insisting on change and renewal.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060976095': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/282762', 'Members': '494', 'Reviews': '6', 'Popularity': '37,086', 'Average rating': '(3.33)', 'Mentions': '13', 'summary': "One of Johnson's most celebrated novels, this horrifying yet touching vision of a nuclear-age America was hailed the New York Times as wildly ambitious.", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books (216|8 points)']}, '9780060976101': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/313031', 'Members': '209', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '98,687', 'Average rating': '(3.4)', 'Mentions': '10', 'summary': 'Set in Nicaragua in 1984, The Stars at Noon is a story of passion, fear, and betrayal told in the voice of an American woman whose mission in Central America is as shadowy as her surroundings.

As Homebody eloquently proves, no contemporary writer outshines Orson Scott Card in crafting unlikely heroes or in suffusing the everyday world with an otherworldly glow. Don Lark's cheery name belies his tragic past. When his alcoholic ex-wife killed their daughter in a car wreck, he retreated from the sort of settled, sociable lifestyle one takes for granted. Only the prospect of putting a roof over other people's heads seems to comfort Lark, and he goes from town to town, looking for dilapidated houses he can buy, restore and resell at a profit. In Greensboro, North Carolina, Lark finds his biggest challenge yet -- a huge, sturdy, gorgeous shell that's suffered almost a century of abuse at the hands of greedy landlords and transient tenants. As he sinks his teeth into this new project, Lark's new neighborhood starts to work its charms on him. He strikes up a romance with the wry real estate agent who sold him the house. His neighbors, two charming, chatty old ladies, ply him endlessly with delicious Southern cooking. Even Sylvie, the squatter Lark was once desperate to evict from the old house, is now growing on him. But when Lark unearths an old tunnel in the cellar, the house's enchantments start to turn ominous. Sylvie turns cantankerous, even dangerous. There's still a steady supply of food from next door, but it now comes laced with increasingly passionate pleas for Lark to vacate the house at once. In short, everybody seems to want to get rid of him. Whether this is for his own good or theirs, Lark digs in his heels for reasons even he's not sure of.

Now at Key West's Old Racquet Club, Chuck gets involved with the wrong married woman--the enticing Clare Carras, married to an enigmatic older man--and soon he is in way over his head. Enter Tommy Sculley, a retired New York homicide detective who has just joined the Key West force, and his young green partner, Daryl Haynes, who turns out to be smarter than he looks. Up to their necks in an investigation of a bizarre apparent homicide, the two detectives barely keep afloat in murky waters.

Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged-and ultimately triumphant-effort to overthrow the Soviet Union. Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan\'s efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the "Evil Empire." The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take--and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency. The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician-still in office today-in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan\'s 1984 reelection bid. Such new finds make The Crusader not just a work of extraordinary history, but a work of explosive revelation that will be debated as hotly in 2006 as Reagan\'s policies were in the 1980s.… (more)', 'characters': ['Robert F.

Its founder was Zeno of Cytium (not to be confused with Zeno of Elea, who discovered the famous paradoxes). He was born in Cyprus about 336 b.c., but all of his philosophical activity took place in Athens. For more than 500 years Stoicism was one of the most influential and fruitful philosophical movements in the Graeco-Roman world. The works of the earlier Stoics survive only in fragmentary quotations from other authors, but from the Renaissance until well into the nineteenth century, Stoic ethical thought was one of the most important ancient influences on European ethics, particularly because of the descriptions of it by Cicero, through surviving works by the Stoics Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and also Epictetus--and also because of the effect that it had had in antiquity, and continued to have into the nineteenth century, on Christian ethical views. Nowadays an undergraduate or graduate student learning about ancient philosophy in a university course may well hear only about Plato and Aristotle, along perhaps with the presocratics; but in the history of Western thought and education this situation is somewhat atypical, and in most periods a comparable student would have learned as much or more about Stoicism, as well as two other major ancient philosophical movements, Epicureanism and Scepticism. In spite of this lack of explicit acquaintance with Stoic philosophers and their works, however, most students will recognize in Epictetus various ideas that are familiar through their effects on other thinkers, notably Spinoza, in our intellectual tradition."… (more)', 'characters': ['Epictetus'], 'awards_and_honors': ['ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (1999.4|Non-fiction, 1999)']}, '9780062512796': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/67869', 'Members': '2,947', 'Reviews': '46', 'Popularity': '3,438', 'Average rating': '(3.4)', 'Mentions': '38', 'summary': "The Pilgrimage paved the way to Paulo Coehlo's international bestselling novel The Alchemist.

In March 1995, agents of a Japanese religious cult attacked the Tokyo subway system with sarin, a gas twenty six times as deadly as cyanide. Attempting to discover why, Murakami conducted hundreds of interviews with the people involved, from the survivors to the perpetrators to the relatives of those who died. Underground is their story in their own voices. Concerned with the fundamental issues that led to the attack as well as these personal accounts, Underground is a document of what happened in Tokyo as well as a warning of what could happen anywhere. This is an enthralling and unique work of nonfiction that is timely, vital, and as brilliantly executed as Murakami's novels. From Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Norwegian Wood, a work of literary journalism that is as fascinating as it is necessary, as provocative as it is profound. It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened; a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack. Attempting to discover why, Murakami conducted hundreds of interviews with the people involved, from a subway authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And, as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere. Hauntingly compelling and inescapably important, Underground is a powerful work of journalistic literature from one of the world's most perceptive writers. Concerned with the fundamental issues that led to the attack as well as these personal accounts, Underground is a document of what happened in Tokyo as well as a warning of what could happen anywhere.

In fact, Chickenhawk is still in print, a book that continues to serve as a testament for an entire generation.

"Although Mason\'s return was at first promising - after leaving active combat duty he began instructing future helicopter pilots - it quickly spiraled downward: into bouts of panic and increasingly heavy drinking, adulterous love affairs, jobs he could never keep. At the spiral\'s bottom lay an epic ocean voyage in a small boat. Destination: Colombia; cargo: marijuana; payoff: capture and a twenty-month prison term." "Mason recounts these events and his gradual healing from the wounds of Vietnam with caustic honesty, in powerful prose that conveys both the texture of despair and the hope that kept him going as he tried to maneuver through his own personal minefield. Above all, he writes with a bitter wisdom that makes this book an anthem for all those vets who lost a piece of themselves in Southeast Asia - and have spend a long, hard time trying to get it back."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Or it begins with a sudden, violent death. Or it begins as Peter Aaron sits down to tell the story of his best friend, Benjamin Sachs - to take us, through a life, to the road in rural Wisconsin where Sachs has accidentally blown himself up. Aaron\'s sole aim is to tell the truth and preserve it, before those who are investigating the case invent a story of their own. Aaron\'s clues are the small mysteries of any lifetime. Sachs had a marriage Aaron envied, an intelligence he admired, a circle of friends he shared. And then suddenly, after a near-fatal fall that might or might not have been intentional, Sachs disappears. For a while, Aaron\'s only link to him is through Maria Turner, an artist, and the one witness to Sachs\'s balcony plunge. Periodically, Sachs reappears, talks manically, and vanishes again - in pursuit of mercy or salvation, in thrall to an idea. Since the first book in his brilliant and acclaimed "New York Trilogy," Paul Auster\'s "rare combination of talent, scope, and audacity" (The New Republic) has given us worlds in which chance and destiny collide, in which solitary protagonists take us on mysterious, soul-wrenching journeys unparalleled in contemporary fiction. His seventh novel is about friendship and betrayal, sexual desire and estrangement, and the unpredictable intrusions of violence in the everyday. Rooted in American mythology and archetype, Leviathan is both timeless and resolutely about this moment.

The result is one of the funniest and most disturbing stories ever told about the corruption of the American dream.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Award (Fiction, 1976)', "Larry McCaffery's 20th Century Greatest Hits (17)", '61 Essential Postmodern Reads (30)', 'The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books (149|10 points)', 'The New Lifetime Reading Plan With Going Further (161.2)']}, '9780140188264': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/424295', 'Members': '220', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '93,475', 'Average rating': '(3.75)', 'Mentions': '39', 'summary': 'In the 1970s Shiva Naipaul travelled to Africa, visiting Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia for several months.

With exclusive and unprecedented access to all of Nin\'s unpublished archives, including more than 250,000 handwritten diary pages, Bair paints a startlingly different portrait of Nin, hitherto best known for her sexual peccadilloes and especially her affair with Henry Miller. Bair reveals Nin\'s lifelong struggle to become a respected writer, to position herself at the right hand of the intellectual elite, and to construct a way of life so complicated that it verged at times on incomprehensibility, even to herself." ""To live life as a dream" was Nin\'s motto, and she did so. She was a bigamist for more than thirty years, creating a "Lie Box" to help her keep her stories straight. And always she kept her diary, which eventually became one of the most astonishing renderings of a contemporary woman\'s life, noted as much for what she left out as for what she included. Bair\'s biography fills in the blanks and shows how Nin reflected the major themes that have come to characterize the latter half of the twentieth century: the quest for the self, the uses of psychoanalysis, and the determination of women to control their own sexuality."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

He chronicles the fifteenth-century politics of the Hanseatic League and the cod wars of the sixteenth and twentieth centuries. He embellishes his story with gastronomic detail, blending in recipes and lore from the Middle Ages to the present. And he brings to life the cod itself: its personality, habits, extended family, and ultimately the tragedy of how the most profitable fish in history is today faced with extinction. From fishing ports in New England and Newfoundland to coastal skiffs, schooners, and factory ships across the Atlantic; from Iceland and Scandinavia to the coasts of England, Brazil, and West Africa, Mark Kurlansky tells a story that brings world history and human passions into captivating focus.

Archie-working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt-is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin.  When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie\'s car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.  Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teeth is the story of two North London families-one headed by Archie, the other by Archie\'s best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal.  Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair.  Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for "no problem").  Samad-devoutly Muslim, hopelessly "foreign"-weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union.  They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd.  The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire\'s worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.  Zadie Smith\'s dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute.

And everywhere are the anomalies that burst the bubble of optimism: a vastly expensive luxury hotel sitting empty in an unknown town six hours from an international airport; museums crammed with fake exhibits.

Here is the month-by month account of the charms and frustrations that Peter Mayle and his wife -- and their two large dogs -- experience their first year in the remote country of the Luberon restoring a two-centuries-old stone farmhouse that they bought on sight. From coping in January with the first mistral, which comes howling down from the Rhone Valley and wreaks havoc with the pipes, to dealing as the months go by with the disarming promises and procrastination of the local masons and plumbers, Peter Mayle delights us with his strategies for survival. He relishes the growing camaraderie with his country neighbors -- despite the rich, soupy, often impenetrable patois that threatens to separate them. He makes friends with boar hunters and truffle hunters, a man who eats foxes, and another who bites dentists; he discovers the secrets of handicapping racing goats and of disarming vipers. And he comes to dread the onslaught of tourists who disrupt his tranquillity. In this often hilarious, seductive book Peter Mayle manages to transport us info all the earthy pleasures of Provencal life and lets us live vicariously in a tempo governed by seasons, not by days.

For Nietzsche, Greek tragedy is the expression of a culture which has achieved a delicate but powerful balance between Dionysian insight into the chaos and suffering whichunderlies all existence and the discipline and clarity of rational Apollonian form.

R. R. Tolkien\'s The Lord of the Rings No poem in German literature is so well known and studied in Germany and Europe as the 800-year-old Das Nibelungenlied. In the English-speaking world, however, the poem has remained little known, languishing without an adequate translation. This wonderful new translation by eminent translator Burton Raffel brings the epic poem to life in English for the first time, rendering it in verse that does full justice to the original High Middle German. His translation underscores the formal aspects of the poem and preserves its haunting beauty. Often called the German lliad, Das Nibelungenlied is a heroic epic both national in character and sweeping in scope. The poem moves inexorably from romance through tragedy to holocaust. It portrays the existential struggles and downfall of an entire people, the Burgundians, in a military conflict with the Huns and their king. In his foreword to the book, Michael Dirda observes that\xa0the story "could be easily updated to describe the downfall of a Mafia crime family, something like The Godfather, with swords." The tremendous appeal of Das Nibelungenlied throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is reflected in such works as Richard Wagner\'s opera tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen, Fritz Lang\'s two-part film Die Nibelungen, and, more recently, J.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated by David Barrett with revisions, an introduction and notes by Shomit Dutta.The master of ancient Greek comic drama, Aristophanes combined slapstick, humour and cheerful vulgarity with acute political observations. In The Frogs, written during the Peloponnesian War, Dionysus descends to the Underworld to bring back a poet who can help Athens in its darkest hour, and stages a great debate to help him decide between the traditional wisdom of Aeschylus and the brilliant modernity of Euripides. The clash of generations and values is also the object of Aristophanes' satire in Wasps, in which an old-fashioned father and his loose-living son come to blows and end up in court. And in Women at the Thesmophoria, the famous Greek tragedian Euripides, accused of misogyny, persuades a relative to infiltrate an all-women festival to find out whether revenge is being plotted against him.Shomit Dutta's introduction discusses Aristophanes' life, the cultural context of his work and conventions of Greek comedy. This updated version of David Barrett's translation also includes extensive notes and a preface for each play.Aristophanes (c.445-386 BC) was probably born in Athens. Little is known about his life, but there is a portrait of him in Plato'sSymposium. He was twice threatened with prosecution for his outspoken attacks on the prominent politician Cleon, but in 405 he was publicly honoured and crowned for promoting Athenian civic unity in The Frogs. Aristophanes had his first comedy produced when he was about twenty-one, and wrote forty plays in all. The eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes are published in the Penguin Classics series as The Birds and Other Plays, Lysistrata and Other Plays, The Wasps and Other Plays and The Frogs and Other Plays.If you enjoyed The Frogs and Other Plays,you might like Aristophanes' Lysistrata and Other Plays, also available in Penguin Classics.… (more)", 'characters': ['Euripides', 'Aeschylus'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780140441734': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/9491', 'Members': '619', 'Reviews': '2', 'Popularity': '28,182', 'Average rating': '(3.46)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '1 / 35', 'summary': "Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot--of the triumvirate that dominated French letters in the eighteenth century, Diderot was unmatched in the sheer breadth and depth of his interests and ideas.

Philippe and Joseph Bridau are two extremely different brothers. The elder, Philippe, is a superficially heroic soldier and adored by their mother Agathe. He is nonetheless a bitter figure, secretly gambling away her savings after a brief but glorious career as Napoleon's aide-de-camp at the battle of Montereau. His younger brother Joseph, meanwhile, is fundamentally virtuous - but their mother is blinded to his kindness by her disapproval of his life as an artist. Foolish and prejudiced, Agathe lives on unaware that she is being cynically manipulated by her own favourite child - but will she ever discover which of her sons is truly the black sheep of the family? A dazzling depiction of the power of money and the cruelty of life in nineteenth-century France, The Black Sheep compellingly explores is a compelling exploration of the nature of deceit.

This Penguin Classics edition of The Complete Essays is translated from the French and edited with an introduction and notes by M.A. Screech. In 1572 Montaigne retired to his estates in order to devote himself to leisure, reading and reflection. There he wrote his constantly expanding 'assays', inspired by the ideas he found in books contained in his library and from his own experience. He discusses subjects as diverse as war-horses and cannibals, poetry and politics, sex and religion, love and friendship, ecstasy and experience. But, above all, Montaigne studied himself as a way of drawing out his own inner nature and that of men and women in general. The Essays are among the most idiosyncratic and personal works in all literature and provide an engaging insight into a wise Renaissance mind, continuing to give pleasure and enlightenment to modern readers. With its extensive introduction and notes, M.A. Screech's edition of Montaigne is widely regarded as the most distinguished of recent times. Michel de Montaigne (1533-1586) studied law and spent a number of years working as a counsellor before devoting his life to reading, writing and reflection.

The result is a major contribution to the art of translation. Those less familiar with Consolation may remember it was written under a death sentence. Boethius (c. 480-524), an Imperial official under Theodoric, Ostrogoth ruler of Rome, found himself, in a time of political paranoia, denounced, arrested, and then executed two years later without a trial. Composed while its author was imprisoned, cut off from family and friends, it remains one of Western literature's most eloquent meditations on the transitory nature of earthly belongings, and the superiority of things of the mind.

The story begins with a historical event, the 1672 lynching of the Dutch Grand Pensionary (roughly equivalent to a modern Prime Minister) Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, by a wild mob of their own countrymen, considered by many as one of the most painful episodes in Dutch history, described by Dumas with a dramatic intensity.The main plot line, involving fictional characters, takes place in the following eighteen months; only gradually does the reader understand its connection with the killing of the de Witt brothers.The city of Haarlem, Netherlands, has set a prize of 100,000 guilders to the person who can grow a black tulip, sparking competition between the country's best gardeners to win the money, honour and fame. Only the city's oldest citizens remember the Tulip Mania thirty years prior, and the citizens throw themselves into the competition. The young and bourgeois Cornelius van Baerle has almost succeeded but is suddenly thrown into the Loevestein prison. . .Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870), also known as Alexandre Dumas, père, was a French writer, best known for his historical novels of high adventure. Translated into nearly 100 languages, these have made him one of the most widely read French authors in the world. Many of his novels, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Ten Years Later were originally published as serials.

Happiness is made up of activities in which we use the best human capacities, both ones that contribute to our flourishing asmembers of a community, and ones that allow us to engage in god-like contemplation.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Greek by David Barrett and Alan H. Sommerstein.The plays in this volume all contain Aristophanes' trademark bawdy comedy and dazzling verbal agility. In The Birds, two cunning Athenians persuade the birds to build the utopian city of 'Much Cuckoo in the Clouds' in the sky, blockading the Olympian gods and installing themselves as new deities. The Knightsis a venomous satire on Cleon, a prominent Athenian demagogue, who vies with a humble sausage-seller for the approval of the people; while The Assembly-Women deals with the battle of the sexes as the women of Athens infiltrate the all-male Assembly in disguise.

For while the naïve Gascon soldier cares little for the politics behind the battles, he is torn apart by a deep passion for two powerful women on opposing sides of the war: Nanon de Lartigues, a keen supporter of the Queen Regent Anne of Austria, and the Victomtesse de Cambes, who supports the rebellious forces of the Princess de Condé. Set around Bordeaux during the first turbulent years of the reign of Louis XIV, The Women's War sees two women taking central stage in a battle for all France. Humorous, dramatic and romantic, it offers a compelling exploration of political intrigue, the power of redemption, the force of love and the futility of war.

Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene uses these questions to guide us toward modern science\'s new and deeper understanding of the universe. From Newton\'s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein\'s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics\' entangled arena where vastly distant objects can bridge their spatial separation to instantaneously coordinate their behavior or even undergo teleportation, Greene reveals our world to be very different from what common experience leads us to believe. Focusing on the enigma of time, Greene establishes that nothing in the laws of physics insists that it run in any particular direction and that "time\'s arrow" is a relic of the universe\'s condition at the moment of the big bang. And in explaining the big bang itself, Greene shows how recent cutting-edge developments in superstring and M-theory may reconcile the behavior of everything from the smallest particle to the largest black hole. This startling vision culminates in a vibrant eleven-dimensional "multiverse," pulsating with ever-changing textures, where space and time themselves may dissolve into subtler, more fundamental entities. Sparked by the trademark wit, humor, and brilliant use of analogy that have made The Elegant Universe a modern classic, Brian Greene takes us all, regardless of ourscientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.

Julie Orringer\'s characters-all of them submerged by loss, whether of parents or lovers or a viable relationship to the world in general-struggle mightily against the wildly engulfing forces that threaten to overtake us all. All of them learn, gloriously if at great cost, how to breathe underwater. In "Pilgrims," a band of motherless children torment each other on Thanksgiving day. In "The Isabel Fish," the sole survivor of a drowning accident takes up scuba diving. In "When She Is Old and I Am Famous," a young woman confronts the inscrutable power of her cousin\'s beauty ("Aida. That is her terrible name. Ai-ee-duh: two cries of pain and one of stupidity"). In "The Smoothest Way Is Full of Stones," the failure of religious and moral codes-to protect, to comfort, to offer solace-is seen through the eyes of a group of Orthodox Jewish adolescents discovering the irresistible power of their burgeoning sexuality. In story after story, Orringer captures moments when the dark contours of the adult world come sharply into focus: Here are young people abandoned to their own devices, thrust too soon into predicaments of insoluble difficulty, and left to fend for themselves against the wide variety of human trouble. Buoyed by the exquisite tenderness of remembered love, they learn to take up residence in this strange new territory, if not to transcend it, and to fashion from their grief new selves, new lives. Orringer\'s debut collection blazes with emotion, with human appetite, with fortitude, with despair; these nine uncommonly wise and assured storiesintroduce an astonishing new talent.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the Year (2003)', 'William Saroyan International Prize for Writing Finalist (Fiction, 2005)']}, '9780141016702': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/155416', 'Members': '2,105', 'Reviews': '26', 'Popularity': '5,601', 'Average rating': '(3.76)', 'Mentions': '52', 'summary': "Prince Hal parts from his past to fulfill his royal destiny in this essential conclusion to Henry IV, Part 1.

It covers a period of intense social change from the 1880s to the 1930s, making direct reference to suffrage, Irish Home Rule, the First World War and anti-semitism. The novel\'s composition history is unusually complex; the text changed radically from its inception in 1931 to its publication in 1937. This edition provides readers with a fully collated and annotated text. It includes a substantial introduction that charts the composition process, a detailed chronology and full annotation of all historical, cultural and topographical references. All variants from extant galley and page proofs, as well as editions of the novel produced in Woolf\'s lifetime, are included, and reveal the significant and crucial changes Woolf made even in the months before publication"--\n"How should we read the writings of Virginia Woolf? This is not so much a question of interpretation as of practice. How are we to read this writer for whom reading is an activity that requires almost the same talents and energies as the activity of writing itself ? For Woolf responds to the question, \'How should one read a book?\', as a person of immense, virtuosic skill and experience in both activities. She understands the reader to be the \'fellow-worker and accomplice\' (E5 573) of the writer. The \'quickest way to understand [. . .] what a novelist is doing is not to read\', she suggests, \'but to write; to make your own experiment with the dangers and difficulties of words\' (E5 574); and \'the time to read poetry\', she recognises, is \'when we are almost able to write it\' (E5 577). Not only has Woolf left a richly rewarding oeuvre, but she has also left ample documentation of her meticulous processes of composition and of her detailed involvement in the production and publishing of many of her works, all of which her active and conscientious reader will wish to negotiate. If we are going to read Woolf creatively and critically, ifwe are to follow our own instincts, use our own reason and come to our own conclusions, as she herself advises, we need to read her works in a form that provides us with the fullest means possible to exercise these powers, one that gives us as much unmediated access as possible to the record of these processes. This Cambridge edition of Woolf\'s writings consequently aims to provide readers and scholars, Woolf\'s fellow-workers and accomplices, with an extensively researched, fully explicated and collated text"--… (more)', 'characters': ['Colonel Abel Pargiter', 'Mira', 'Lulu', 'Eleanor Pargiter'], 'awards_and_honors': ['1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006 Edition)', 'Publishers Weekly Bestseller (Fiction, 1937)', "Western World's Greatest Books - Project Gutenberg", 'Audie Award Finalist (Classics, 2007)']}, '9780141185361': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/3570', 'Members': '2,300', 'Reviews': '41', 'Popularity': '4,929', 'Average rating': '(3.59)', 'Mentions': '103', 'summary': 'Through the eyes of Miss Toklas, Gertrude Stein reviews both of their lives before their meeting and during their years of companionship.', 'characters': ['Alice B.

Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero\'s foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collins\'s narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins\'s other great mystery, The Moonstone, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of The Woman in White."… (more)', 'characters': ['Count Fosco', 'Marian Halcombe', 'Laura Fairlie Glyde', 'Percival Glyde', 'Anne Catherick', 'Walter Hartright', 'Frederick Fairlie', 'Countess Fosco', 'Mrs Clements', 'Vincent Gilmore', 'Eliza Michelson', 'Mrs Catherick', 'Pesca', 'Mr. Kyrle'], 'awards_and_honors': ["BBC's Big Read (Best loved novel, 2003, No 77)", "The Observer's 100 Greatest Novels of All Time (23)", 'Guardian 1000 (Crime)', '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006/2008/2010/2012 Edition)', "The Telegraph's 110 Best Books: The Perfect Library (2008)", "Julian Symons' 100 Best Crime Stories (1860)", "Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time - UK Crime Writers' Association (28)", 'The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time Mystery Writers of America (32)', "Daniel S.

Based on the experiences of her father, who was a young boy in the Philippines during World War II, Holthe's story begins during the final week of the ferocious Japanese-American battle for possession of the Philippines. Here, we listen to three distinct narrators who reveal the struggle to survive in a small community outside Manila, where the streets are littered with dead bodies and the threat of capture by Japanese soldiers is around every corner. First, thirteen-year-old Alejandro Karangalan and his younger brother leave the safety of the basement where his family and others are hiding to go look for food for their family and medicine for their ailing father. They are caught by Japanese militants and wrongly accused of murder. Meanwhile, Alejandro's older sister, Isabelle, has been missing for days. As the family fears for her safety, Isabelle is met with the choice of avoiding a Japanese patrol or helping an injured guerrilla commander, whom she believes is responsible for the brutal Japanese counterattacks on their people. Her decisions lead her through a maelstrom of events that leave her stripped of her soul. At the same time, Domingo Matapang, the passionate guerilla commander, is torn between his pivotal role of helping his troops defeat the enemy, or protecting the lives of his wife and child. Will he follow the path of a warrior and a future with his soulmate, Chita, a feisty double agent, or the path of a provider for his wife Lorna and his beloved sons? As the war rages outside, five tales of hope and superstition unfold in the cellar. The stories, which are fueled by the myths and superstitions that were told with reverence in Holthe's Filipino household, help the civilians endure the atrocities and find hope in the midst of chaos.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['School Library Journal Best Book of the Year (2002)']}, '9780142003268': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/38539', 'Members': '1,957', 'Reviews': '36', 'Popularity': '6,218', 'Average rating': '(3.09)', 'Mentions': '66', 'summary': "The Spy Who Loved Meis the tenth of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, where the British agent, in America, rescues a damsel in distress...

He set this legend in a small, minutely realized parallel universe that he called Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. No single volume better conveys the scope of Faulkner\'s vision than The Portable Faulkner. The book includes self-contained episodes from the novels The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, and Sanctuary; the stories\xa0"The Bear," "Spotted Horses," "A Rose for Emily," and "Old Man," among others; a map of Yoknapatawpha County and a chronology of the Compson family created by Faulkner especially for this edition; and the complete text of Faulkner\'s 1950 address upon receiving the Nobel Prize in literature.

According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is "a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all." Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow\'s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today\'s America is the result of Hamilton\'s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. "To repudiate his legacy," Chernow writes, "is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world." Chernow here recounts Hamilton\'s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington\'s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States. Historians have long told the story of America\'s birth as the triumph of Jefferson\'s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we\'ve encountered before-from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton\'s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804. Chernow\'s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America\'s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.… (more)', 'characters': ['Alexander Hamilton', 'Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton', 'James Madison', 'Aaron Burr', 'John Jay', 'George Washington', 'Thomas Jefferson', 'Abigail Adams', 'Charles Adams', 'Henry Adams', 'John Adams', 'John Quincy Adams', 'Samuel Adams', 'Joseph Addison', 'William Alexander, Lord Stirling', 'Theodosia Burr', 'Fisher Ames', 'John André', 'Richard Arkwright', 'Benedict Arnold', 'Margaret Shippen Arnold', 'Benjamin Franklin Bache', 'Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626', 'Bernard Bailyn', 'Francis Barber', 'John Barbot', 'James A.

Barcelona, 1945-just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother's face. To console his only child, Daniel's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel's father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax's work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly. As with all astounding novels, The Shadow of the Wind sends the mind groping for comparisons- The Crimson Petal and the White? The novels of Arturo Peacute-Reverte? Of Victor Hugo? Love in the Time of Cholera ?-but in the end, as with all astounding novels, no comparison can suffice. As one leading Spanish reviewer wrote, ldquo. The originality of Ruiz Zafoacute's voice is bombproof and displays a diabolical talent. The Shadow of the Wind announces a phenomenon in Spanish literature. An uncannily absorbing historical mystery, a heart-piercing romance, and a moving homage to the mystical power of books, The Shadow of the Wind is a triumph of the storyteller's art.… (more)", 'characters': ['Daniel Sempere', 'Beatriz Aguilar', 'Fermín Romero de Torres', 'Inspector Fumero', 'Tomas Aguilar', 'Julian Carax', 'Penelope Aldaya'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Waterstones top 25 books of the last 25 years (2007, No 6)', 'Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger [2004]', 'Barry Award (First Novel, 2005)', 'Gumshoe Award nominee (European Crime Novel, 2005)', 'Meilleur livre étranger (Roman, 2004)', 'Prix des libraires du Québec (Roman hors Québéc, 2005)', 'Borders Original Voices (2005)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Honor Book (2005.7 | Adult Fiction Honor Book, 2005)', 'NPR Top 100 Killer Thrillers (71)', '50 Great Hispanic Novels Every Student Should Read (4)', 'Dilys Award nominee (2005)', 'Prix des Lecteurs du Livre de Poche (2006)', 'Grand Prix Littéraire de Saint-Emilion Pomerol Fronsac (Prix Roman étranger, 2005)', 'Prix des Amis du Scribe (2005)', 'Prix Michelet (2005)', '100 лучших романов XXI века по версии журнала "Афиша"', '50 Best Suspense Books of All Time']}, '9780143035169': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/75958', 'Members': '710', 'Reviews': '20', 'Popularity': '23,684', 'Average rating': '(3.71)', 'Mentions': '68', 'summary': '"In her fictional biography, The Stone Diaries, Carol Shields created an astonishing portrait of Daisy Goodwill Flett, a modern woman struggling to understand her place in her own life.

The New Europe is a place where college education is free, doctors still make house calls (with no bill to pay), and corporate "downsizing" is against the law.
