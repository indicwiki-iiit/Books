## Raw Data

Check out these files if you'd like to know how the final dataset was made from these elementary ones by collecting series of attributes, one by one. </ br>

v1 and v2 contain data and attributes obtained only from **Google Books**. Rest of the datasets have additional attributes obtained from other sources such as **LibraryThing**, **Amazon**, **WorldCat**, and many more.< /br>

To know more on attributes collected and their sources, please visit the **Report** in the home page of this branch, or via [this](https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Books/blob/new/Books%20-%20Report.pdf) link.
