## Raw Templates

Check out each of these folders for some primitive versions of the template we've worked on, and the datasets used to render them at those points in time. Each folder comprises of - 
* A **render.py** file, used to render the article for a single record from the database
* A **merged_pickle_v__.zip** file, containing the dataset used to render the article at that point in the .pkl forma
* A **template** ( which may be identified using the **.j2** extension )
