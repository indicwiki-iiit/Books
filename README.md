# Books

Welcome to the repository of "Books"! Follow the guide below if you'd like to navigate across this repository and view files, or if you'd like to implement specific chunks of this project on your computer.

You may also check this detailed **report** on the Tewiki Books project [here](https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Books/blob/main/Books%20-%20Report.pdf) to know how to navigate through all the files listed here, and to know the multiple technical and other facets of this project.

## Guide to using these files/implementing/testing

* Download this repository as a ZIP, or clone it to your computer.
* To test article rendering for a single record, use the script "**render.py**".
* To test article rendering and XML Generation for all records in the database, use the script "**genXML.py**".
* Both of the aforementioned scripts need the template of the article and the database, which are in the folders **template** and **data** respectively, so make sure both of these folders are present in your cloned copy.

If you'd like to know more about the scripts used to construct the database and the template, visit the [raw_files](https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Books/tree/main/raw_files) folder. 

To know what the rendered article would look like, before you render it, check out the "Books - Sample Article.pdf" file or [this](https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Books/blob/main/Books%20-%20Sample%20Article.pdf) document.

### 📜 genXML.py
Use this file if you'd like to generate the XML file comprising of records from all 6500 books in the database, enclosed within mediawiki tags. Note that this should be run only after the entire repo is cloned/downloaded, since this script needs access to the template and dataset lodged in other folders.
