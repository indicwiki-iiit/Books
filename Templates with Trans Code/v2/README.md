The previous version of the dataset was in "merged_pickle_v3.pkl". Publication dates have been updated in this file using recently collected data, to give "merged_pickle_v32.pkl".

Owing to dual sourcing of publication date from Amazon and Google Books, that too in different formats, which does not exist now because **all new data is sourced from Google Books New Site ** ,a chunk of code has been eliminated/changed in render.py and trans_render.py too.
