When Ben chances upon Jimmy Cavanaugh, an old college friend, Cavanaugh promptly pulls out a gun and tries to kill him. In a matter of minutes, several innocent bystanders are dead - as well as Cavanaugh - and Ben has barely managed to survive. Plunged into an unspeakable nightmare, Hartman suddenly finds himself on the run. Department of Justice field agent Anna Navarro is being stalked around the world by a relentless killer, managing to survive the killer's attacks only by a combination of luck, skill and her own quick wits. These attacks are somehow related to her current assignment: investigating the sudden - and seemingly unrelated - deaths of a number of very old men throughout the world. The only thing that connects them is a file in the CIA archives, over a half-century old, marked with the same puzzling code word: SIGMA. But someone or something is always seemingly one step ahead of her, the survivors are rapidly dwindling, and her own life is in ever increasing danger. Brought together by accident, Ben and Anna soon realize that their only hope of survival lies with each other. Together they race to uncover the diabolical secrets long hidden behind the code word, Sigma. Secrets that threaten everything they think they know about themselves, everything they believed true about their friends and families, and everything they were ever taught about history itself.

As a result, vampire lore is extremely diverse. So too, representations of the vampire in creative works have been marked by much originality. In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. This tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman as the archetypal vampire firmly in the public imagination. Numerous films drew from Stoker's novel to varying degrees, with each emphasizing different elements of his vampire character. And more recent writers have created works in which vampirism is used to explore contemporary social concerns.The contributors to this volume discuss representations of the vampire in fiction, folklore, film, and popular culture. The first section includes chapters on Stoker and his works, with attention to such figures as Oscar Wilde and Edvard Munch. The second section explores the vampire in film and popular culture from Bela Lugosi to Blacula.

But every day the dwindling crew becomes more deranged and mutinous, until even Crozier begins to fear there may be no escape from an ever-more-inconceivable nightmare.… (more)", 'characters': ['Sir John Franklin', 'Francis Rawdon Moira Crozier', 'Lady Silence', 'Cornelius Hickey', 'Third Lieutenant John Irving', 'Dr. McDonald', 'Mr. Thompson', 'Seaman Manson', 'Marine Private Wilkes', 'Able Seaman Shanks'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Bram Stoker Award Nominee (2007.1|Novel, 2007)', 'Shirley Jackson Award Finalist (2007|Novel, 2007)', 'British Fantasy Award Nominee (2008.1|August Derleth Fantasy Award, 2008)', 'International Horror Guild Award (Novel, 2007)', "SF Site Reader's Choice (2007)", 'Black Quill Award Nominee (2007.05|Dark Genre Novel of the Year, 2007)', "Paste Magazine's 50 Best Horror Novels of All-Time (24)", 'NPR 100 Best Horror Novels and Stories (Hell is Other People: Real World Horrors)', 'Greatest Books algorithm (#2463)', "Historical Novel Society Editors' Choice (Nautical Adventure Thriller)"]}, '9780316066143': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1578992', 'Members': '687', 'Reviews': '21', 'Popularity': '24,720', 'Average rating': '(3.53)', 'Mentions': '12', 'summary': "For a cop, a night on the job means killing time and trying not to get killed. If you're a cop in Hollywood Division, it also means dealing with the most overwrought, desperate, and deluded criminals anywhere. When you're patrolling Sunset and Hollywood Boulevards, neither a good reputation nor the lessons of scandals past will help you keep your cool, your sanity, or your life when things heat up. The robbery of a Hollywood jewelry store, complete with masks and a hand grenade, quickly connects to a Russian nightclub, an undercover operation gone bloodily wrong, and a cluelessly ambitious pair of tweakers. Putting the pieces together are the sergeant they call the Oracle and his squad of street cops. There's Budgie Polk, a twenty-something firecracker with a four-month-old at home, and Wesley Drubb, a rich boy who joined the force seeking thrills. Fausto Gamboa is the tetchy veteran, and Hollywood Nate is the one who never shuts up about movies.

This one is personal. Billy Meadows was a fellow Vietnam "tunnel rat," fighting the VC and the fear they used to call the Black Echo. Harry let Meadows down once. He won\'t do it again. The Black Ice The corpse in the hotel room seems to be that of a missing LAPD narcotics officer. Rumors abound that the cop had crossed over-selling a new drug called Black Ice. Now Harry\'s making some dangerous connections, leading from the cop to a string of bloody murders, and from Hollywood Boulevard\'s drug bazaar to Mexico\'s dusty back alleys. In this lethal game, Harry is likely to be the next victim. The Concrete Blonde When Harry Bosch shot and killed Norman Church, the police were convinced it marked the end of the hunt for the Dollmaker-L.A.\'s most bizarre serial killer. But now Church\'s widow is accusing Harry of killing the wrong man-a charge that rings terrifyingly true when a new victim is discovered with the Dollmaker\'s macabre signature. For the second time, Harry must hunt the murderer down, before he strikes again.

Here readers will find the fascinating insights and groundbreaking revelations found in An unfinished life. The heart of the book focuses on Kennedy\'s political career, especially the presidency. The book sheds light on key foreign affairs issues such as the Bay of Pigs debacle, Khrushchev\'s misguided bullying of Kennedy in Vienna, the Cuban Missile crisis, the nuclear test ban, the race for space, and the initial dealings with Southeast Asia, especially Laos. It also highlights the difficulties Kennedy faced getting a domestic agenda passed, from a tax cut to spur the economy, to federal aid to education, Medicare, and civil rights. Dallek reveals the thinking behind Robert Kennedy\'s appointment as attorney general and convincingly argues that Kennedy would never have expanded the war in Vietnam the way that Lyndon Johnson did. The book also addresses questions about Kennedy\'s assassination and concludes with his presidential legacy and why he remains so popular despite serving only a thousand days in office.

The life of Rumer Godden, one of our best-loved contemporary authors, has been as eventful and dramatic as the plot of any of her novels. Born in India to English parents at the height of British colonial power, she always knew she wanted to be a writer. Her literary career has spanned six decades. In 1939, Black Narcissus became an overnight bestseller in England and America and it has remained in print ever since. The film she scripted for Jean Renoir in 1949 from her own novel, The River, has become one of the classics of the cinema. Anne Chisholm's biography places Rumer Godden's work in the context of her remarkable life. At the heart of Godden's writing is her idyllic childhood in Bengal. In her twenties, she established her own dancing school in Calcutta and was disapproved of as a working woman and as a teacher of Eurasian girls. Although she married in 1934 and had two daughters, she was a fiercely determined writer who struggled to reconcile her need to write with the demands of her family. As her marriage failed, she retreated from the decadence of fading colonial Calcutta to the tea plantations of Assam and then the mountains of Kashmir. But Godden's relationship with India, though passionate, was ultimately ambivalent. In Kashmir a servant tried to poison her and her children (an extraordinary incident which brought this ambivalence to a head). The notoriety surrounding the case forced Godden to leave Kashmir, soon afterwards she left India for good. This mysterious episode is explored here in detail. On returning to England, she built a new life marrying again and continuing to write. Her conversion to Catholicism led her to write one of her best-known books, In This House of Brede. Several of her novels and children's books were filmed or adapted for television, including The Greengage Summer, Vie Diddakoi and The Peacock Spring Through conversations with Rumer Godden herself and from her exclusive access to private letters, Anne Chisholm has written the definitive story of an emotionally powerful writer and a woman of unusual strength of character.… (more)", 'characters': ['Rumer Godden'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780330371223': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/9750639', 'Members': '6,669', 'Reviews': '101', 'Popularity': '1,071', 'Average rating': '(3.96)', 'Mentions': '77', 'summary': 'Stephanie Plum and a rival bounty hunter vie to capture a revenge-seeking waitress wanted for theft and extortion.', 'characters': ['Stephanie Plum', 'Ranger', 'Joe Morelli', 'Grandma Mazur', 'Lula', 'Sally Sweet', 'Joyce Barnhardt', 'Maxine Nowicki'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Lefty Award (Humorous Mystery, 1999)']}, '9780330371230': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/9750708', 'Members': '6,529', 'Reviews': '80', 'Popularity': '1,103', 'Average rating': '(3.95)', 'Mentions': '72', 'summary': 'Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum and her usual cohorts search for seventy-two year old Uncle Fred who has a drawer full of photographs of body parts.', 'characters': ['Stephanie Plum', 'Grandma Mazur', 'Lula', 'Ranger', 'Joe Morelli'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 1999)', 'Anthony Award Nominee (Novel, 2000)', 'Lefty nominee (Humorous Mystery, 2000)']}, '9780330371247': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/9750707', 'Members': '6,441', 'Reviews': '90', 'Popularity': '1,114', 'Average rating': '(3.95)', 'Mentions': '57', 'summary': 'Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum and Trenton vice cop Joe Morelli join forces to find the madman killer who shot and barbecued the youngest son of international black-market arms dealer Alexander Ramos.', 'characters': ['Stephanie Plum', 'Grandma Mazur', 'Lula', 'Joe Morelli', "Bob (Joe's dog)", 'Ranger'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 2000)', 'Dilys Award nominee (2001)']}, '9780330373579': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/844752', 'Members': '171', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '122,358', 'Average rating': '(3.88)', 'Mentions': '5', 'summary': "An insightful and personal examination of Catholicism in Europe.For four years from 1990, Colm Tóibin made a series of trips through Catholic Europe.

Malcolm examines the different religious and ethnic inhabitants of Bosnia, a land of vast cultural upheaval where the empires of Rome, Charlemagne, the Ottomans, and the Austro-Hungarians overlapped. Clarifying the various myths that have clouded the modern understanding of Bosnia's past, Malcolm brings to light the true causes of the country's destruction. This expanded edition of Bosnia includes a new epilogue by the author examining the failed Vance-Owen peace plan, the tenuous resolution of the Dayton Accords, and the efforts of the United Nations to keep the uneasy peace. What went wrong in the country where Christians and Muslims mingled and tolerated each other for over five centuries? It was a land with a vibrant political and cultural history, unlike any other in Europe, where great powers and religions-the empires of Rome, Charlemagne, the Ottomans; the faiths of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Islam overlapped and combined. In this first English-language history of Bosnia, Noel Malcolm provides a narrative chronicle of the country from its beginnings to its tragic end. Clarifying the various myths that have clouded the modern understanding of Bosnia's past, Malcolm brings to light the true causes of the country's destruction: the political strategy of the Serbian leadership, the conflict between the city and the countryside, the fatal inaction and miscalculations of Western politicians. Putting the Bosnia war into perspective, this volume celebrates the complex history of a country whose past, as well as its future, has been all but erased. At last, here is the guide for the general reader seeking a comprehensive and accessible account of the war in the former Yugoslavia.

In UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ₃divinely inspired₄ crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America\'s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief. Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five "plural wives," several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents. Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism\'s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.… (more)', 'characters': ['Ron Lafferty', 'Dan Lafferty', 'Joseph Smith', 'Allen Lafferty', 'Young, Brigham, 1801–1877', 'Brenda Lafferty', 'Erica Lafferty', 'Brian David Mitchell', 'Rulon Jeffs', 'Warren Jeffs', 'John D.

Every year millions of Americans celebrate St. Patrick\'s Day, but they may not be aware of how great an influence St. Patrick was on the subsequent history of civilization. Not only did he bring Christianity to Ireland, he instilled a sense of literacy and learning that would create the conditions that allowed Ireland to become "the isle of saints and scholars" -- and thus preserve Western culture while Europe was being overrun by barbarians. In this entertaining and compelling narrative, Thomas Cahill tells the story of how Europe evolved from the classical age of Rome to the medieval era. Without Ireland, the transition could not have taken place. Not only did Irish monks and scribes maintain the very record of Western civilization -- copying manuscripts of Greek and Latin writers, both pagan and Christian, while libraries and learning on the continent were forever lost -- they brought their uniquely Irish world-view to the task. As Cahill delightfully illustrates, so much of the liveliness we associate with medieval culture has its roots in Ireland. When the seeds of culture were replanted on the European continent, it was from Ireland that they were germinated. In the tradition of Barbara Tuchman\'s A Distant Mirror, How The Irish Saved Civilization reconstructs an era that few know about but which is central to understanding our past and our cultural heritage. But it conveys its knowledge with a winking wit that aptly captures the sensibility of the unsung Irish who relaunched civilization.… (more)', 'characters': ['Augustus Caesar', 'Alaric', 'Saint Patrick', 'Medb'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780340654163': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/286668', 'Members': '110', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '191,989', 'Average rating': '(3.43)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "The Shah is thrown out of Iran and the nation's turmoil becomes world headlines.

But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, still it remained lost to him.… (more)", 'characters': ['Frodo Baggins', 'Samwise Gamgee', 'Aragorn II', 'Gandalf', 'Peregrin Took (Pippin)', 'Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry)', 'Gimli', 'Legolas', 'Gollum', 'Faramir', 'Saruman the White', 'Éowyn', 'Théoden', 'Denethor II', 'Aldor', 'Anárion', 'Angbor', 'Rowlie Appledore', 'Arod', 'Arwen Undómiel', 'Bilbo Baggins', 'Baldor', 'Willie Banks', 'Baranor', 'Beregond', 'Beren', 'Bergil', 'Bob', 'Fredegar Bolger', 'Tom Bombadil', 'Brego', 'Barliman Butterbur', 'Celeborn', 'Celebrían', 'Círdan', 'Tolman "Tom" Cotton', 'Wilcome "Jolly" Cotton', 'Lily Cotton', 'Carl "Nibs" Cotton', 'Bowman "Nick" Cotton', 'Rose "Rosie" Gardner (née Cotton)', 'Tolman "Young Tom" Cotton', 'Daeron', 'Dáin II Ironfoot', 'Déor', 'Déorwine', 'Derufin', 'Dervorin', 'Dior', 'Duilin', 'Duinhir', 'Dúnhere', 'Durin', 'Eärendil', 'Eärnur', 'Ecthelion', 'Varda Elentári', 'Elendil', 'Elfhelm', 'Elladan', 'Elrond Half-elven', 'Éomer', 'Éomund', 'Eorl', 'Erestor', 'Fangorn', 'Fastred', 'Fëanor', 'Felaróf', 'Fengel', 'Bill Ferny', 'Finduilas', 'Folca', 'Folcwine', 'Forlong the Fat', 'Fréa', 'Fréaláf Hildeson', 'Fréawine', 'Galadriel', 'Elanor Gardner', 'Hamfast Gamgee', 'Ghân-buri-Ghân', 'Gildor Inglorion', 'Glóin', 'Glorfindel', 'Golasgil', 'Goldwine', 'Gorbag', 'Gothmag', 'Gram', 'Gríma Wormtongue', 'Grimbold', 'Guthláf', 'Gwaihir', 'Halbarad', 'Harding', 'Hasufel', 'Hob Hayward', 'Mat Heathertoes', 'Helm Hammerhand', 'Herefara', 'Herubrand', 'Hirgon', 'Hirluin', 'Horn', 'Húrin the Tall', 'Imrahil', 'Ingold', 'Ioreth', 'Iorlas', 'Isildur', 'Witch-king of Angmar', 'Lagduf', 'Landroval', 'Brytta Léofa', 'Lightfoot [Lord Of The Rings]', 'Lúthien Tinúviel', 'Mablung', 'Malbeth the Seer', 'Mardil Voronwë', 'Marigold Cotton', 'Mayor of the Shire', 'Meneldor', 'Morgoth Bauglir', 'Mouth of Sauron', 'Muzgash', 'Nimrodel', 'Oromë', 'Tom Pickthorn', 'Radbug', 'Widow Rumble', 'Lobelia Sackville-Baggins', 'Lotho Sackville-Baggins', 'Sandyman the Miller', 'Ted Sandyman', 'Sauron', 'Scatha', 'Shadowfax', 'Shagrat', 'Shelob', 'Silent Watchers', 'Robin Smallburrow', 'Smaug', 'Snowmane', 'Strider (pony)', 'Stybba', 'Targon', 'Thengel', 'Thorondor', 'Thráin II', 'Thrór', 'Gerontius Took', 'Paladin II Took', 'Treebeard', 'Valandil of Arnor', 'Vorondil the Hunter', 'Walda', 'Warden of the Houses of Healing', 'Will Whitfoot', 'Widfara', 'Windfola', 'Ar-Adûnakhôr', 'Amandil', 'Amroth'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay (2003)', 'Whitcoulls top 100, 2008', "The Telegraph's 110 Best Books: The Perfect Library", '1001 böcker du måste läsa innan du dör']}, '9780345340443': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/4529406', 'Members': '315', 'Reviews': '5', 'Popularity': '62,783', 'Average rating': '(4.03)', 'Mentions': '40', 'summary': '', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['Prix Julia Verlanger (1991)', 'Locus 1998 Poll, All-Time Best Fantasy Novel Before 1990 (12)', "NPR's Top 100 Science-Fiction, Fantasy Books (41)"]}, '9780345345066': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/3203401', 'Members': '3,160', 'Reviews': '18', 'Popularity': '3,107', 'Average rating': '(3.91)', 'Mentions': '39', 'summary': 'Stories, poems and an essay by the author of "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings."', 'characters': ['Tom Bombadil', 'Goldberry', 'Niggle', 'Parish [in Leaf by Niggle]'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780345346292': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/52747', 'Members': '3,168', 'Reviews': '29', 'Popularity': '3,098', 'Average rating': '(4.06)', 'Mentions': '55', 'summary': 'Dr. Carl Sagan Takes Us on a Great Reading Adventure, Offering his Vivid and Startling Insight Into the Brain of Man and Beast, the Origin of Human Intelligence, the Function of our Most Haunting Legends -- and Their Amazing Links to Recent Discoveries.

The saga of "the ship that cannot possibly go wrong" sparkles with wit, danger, and confusion that will keep readers guessing which reality they are in and how, on earth, to find their way out again. At the center of the galaxy, a vast, unknown civilization is preparing for an event of epic proportions: the launching of the greatest, most gorgeous, most technologically advanced Starship ever built-the Starship Titanic. An earthling would see it as a mixture of the Chrysler Building, the tomb of Tutankhamen, and Venice. But less provincial onlookers would recognize it as the design of Leovinus, the galaxy\'s most renowned architect. He is an old man now, and the creation of the Starship Titanic is the pinnacle achievement of his twenty-year career. The night before the launch, Leovinus is prowling around the ship having a last little look. With mounting alarm he begins to find things are not right: unfinished workmanship, cybersystems not working correctly, robots colliding with doors. How could this have happened? And how could this have happened without his knowing? Something somewhere is terribly wrong. On the following day, in an artificial event staged for the media, the Starship Titanic will leave its construction dock under autopilot and, a few days later, make its way to the terminal to pick up passengers for its maiden voyage. Although the ship will be deserted during its very first flight, it is nevertheless a major event, watched by all the galaxy\'s media. Hugely, magnificently, the fabulous ship eases its way forward from the construction dock, picks up speed, sways a bit, wobbles a bit, veers wildly, and just before it can do massive damage to everything around it, appears to undergo SMEF (Spontaneous Massive Existence Failure). In just ten seconds, the whole, stupendous enterprise is over. And our story has just begun. Somehow three earthlings, one Blerontin journalist, a semideranged parrot, and a shipful of disoriented robots must overcome their differences. It\'s the only way to save the Starship Titanic ("The Ship That Cannot Possibly Go Wrong") from certain destruction and rescue the economy of an entire planet-not to mention to survive the latest threat, an attack by a swarm of hostile shipbuilders. . . .… (more)', 'characters': ['Leovinus', 'The Journalist', 'Brobostigon', 'Scraliontis', 'Lucy', 'Nettie', 'Dan', 'Titania', 'Doorbot'], 'awards_and_honors': ['NCTE Books For You: An Annotated Booklist for Senior High (2001|14th Edition: 1997-1999)']}, '9780345373946': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/153493', 'Members': '473', 'Reviews': '6', 'Popularity': '39,042', 'Average rating': '(3.96)', 'Mentions': '5', 'summary': 'Collected for the first time, here are the twelve extraordinary illustrated volumes that form the graphic novel of THE VAMPIRE LESTAT.

Karen Armstrong\'s masterly and illuminating book explores the ways in which the idea and experience of God evolved among the monotheists--Jews, Christians and Muslims. Weaving a multicolored fabric of historical, philosophical, intellectual and social developments and insights, Armstrong shows how, at various times through the centuries, each of the monotheistic religions has held a subtly different concept of God. At the same time she draws our attention to the basic and profound similarities among them, making it clear that in all of them God has been and is experienced intensely, passionately and often--especially in the West--traumatically. Some monotheists have seen darkness, desolation and terror, where others have seen light and transfiguration; the reasons for these inherent differences are examined, and the people behind them are brought to life. We look first at the gradual move away from the pagan gods to the full-fledged monotheism of the Jews during the exile in Babylon. Next considered is the development of parallel, yet different, perceptions and beliefs among Christians and Muslims. The book then moves "generationally" through time to examine the God of the philosophers and mystics in all three traditions, the God of the Reformation, the God of the Enlightenment and finally the nineteenth- and twentieth-century challenges of skeptics and atheists, as well as the fiercely reductive faith of the fundamentalists of our own day. Armstrong suggests that any particular idea of God must--if it is to survive--work for the people who develop it, and that ideas of God change when they cease to be effective. She argues that the concept of a personal God who behaves like a larger version of ourselves was suited to mankind at a certain stage but no longer works for an increasing number of people." "Understanding the ever-changing ideas of God in the past and their relevance and usefulness in their time, she says, is a way to begin the search for a new concept for the twenty-first century. Her book shows that such a development is virtually inevitable, in spite of the despair of our increasingly "Godless" world, because it is a natural aspect of our humanity to seek a symbol for the ineffable reality that is universally perceived."--Publisher\'s description.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 1994)', 'Book of the Month Club Alternate']}, '9780345391698': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/38719', 'Members': '2,551', 'Reviews': '29', 'Popularity': '4,230', 'Average rating': '(3.9)', 'Mentions': '59', 'summary': '"In The Battle for God, Karen Armstrong shows us how and why fundamentalist groups came into existence and what they yearn to accomplish." "We see the West in the sixteenth century beginning to create an entirely new kind of civilization, which brought in its wake change in every aspect of life - often painful and violent, even if liberating. Armstrong argues that one of the things that changed most was religion. People could no longer think about or experience the divine in the same why; they had to develop new forms of faith to fit their new circumstances." "Armstrong characterizes fundamentalism as one of these new ways of being religious that have emerged in every major faith tradition. She examines the ways in which these movements, while not monolithic, have each sprung from a dread of modernityoften in response to assault (sometimes unwitting, sometimes intentional) by the mainstream society." "Armstrong sees fundamentalist groups as complex, innovative, and modern - rather than as throwbacks to the past - but contends that they have failed in religious terms. Maintaining that fundamentalism often exists in symbiotic relationship with an aggressive modernity, each impelling the other on to greater excess, she suggests compassion as a way to defuse what is now an intensifying conflict."--Jacket.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ["Booklist Editor's Choice (History, 2000)"]}, '9780345396358': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/5694', 'Members': '927', 'Reviews': '8', 'Popularity': '16,961', 'Average rating': '(3.46)', 'Mentions': '1', 'summary': 'Thompson delivers a mind-bending view of the 1992 presidential race, packed with all the horror, sacrifice, lust, and glory that made this campaign so utterly fascinating.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 1994)']}, '9780345396532': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/475', 'Members': '3,197', 'Reviews': '27', 'Popularity': '3,068', 'Average rating': '(3.62)', 'Mentions': '18', 'summary': 'Horrified by the misuse of magic they had witnessed during the First War of the Races, the Druids at Paranor devoted themselves to the study of the old sciences, from the period before the collapse of civilization a thousand years before.

His goal is two fold: to find and control the fabled ancient books of magic, and to destroy the dark disciple who betrayed him - the Ilse Witch.

Loyal to none but herself and lethal even to those closest to her, Shadea a'Ru now holds sway as High Druid of Paranor-her ascension to power all but unchallenged in the wake of Grianne Ohmsford's sudden, mysterious vanishing. Only Shadea and her cats paw-the treacherous Prime Minister Sen Dunsidan-know the secret fate of the true Ard Rhys, for it was they who engineered it, by means of dark magic. And now Grianne languishes in the fearsome and inescapable netherworld called the Forbidding. Their bloodless coup a success, the corrupt pair, and their confederates within the Druid Council, seeks to make their dominion over the Four Lands absolute-with the aid of a devastating new weapon. But it could all be undone if Grianne's young nephew, Penderrin, succeeds in his frantic quest to rescue her. Shadea's airship-borne minions and the relentless assassin under her command continue their fierce pursuit of Pen and his comrades. Eluding death is only half the battle for Pen. To breach the Forbidding and bring Grianne back to the natural world means finding the fabled Tanequil, and the talisman it alone can provide. That means journeying into the Inkrim-a dreaded region thick with shadows and haunted by harrowing legends. It also means striking a bargain direr than Pen could ever imagine.

Little league coaches, scared of liability, stop volunteering. Schools and hospitals start to crumble. The common good fades, replaced by a cacophony of people claiming their “individual rights.” By turns funny and infuriating, this startling book dissects the dogmas of fairness that allow self-interested individuals to bully the rest of society. Philip K. Howard explains how, trying to honor individual rights, we removed the authority needed to maintain a free society. Teachers don’t even have authority to maintain order in the classroom. With no one in charge, the safe course is to avoid any possible risk. Seesaws and diving boards are removed. Ridiculous warning labels litter the American landscape: “Caution: Contents Are Hot.” Striving to protect “individual rights,” we ended up losing much of our freedom. When almost any decision that someone disagrees with is a possible lawsuit, no one knows where he stands. A huge monument to the unknown plaintiff looms high above America, casting a dark shadow across our daily choices. Today, in the land of free speech, you’d have to be a fool to say what you really think. This provocative book not only attacks the sacred cows of political correctness, but takes a breathtakingly bold stand on how to reinvigorate our common good. Only by restoring personal authority can schools begin to work again. Only by judges and legislatures taking back the authority to decide who can sue for what can doctors feel comfortable using their best judgment and American be liberated to say and do what they know is right.

Paris and Antwerp have recently emerged as important new centers of Jewish culture. Small but proud Jewish communities are revitalizing the ancient centers of Budapest, Prague, and Amsterdam. These brave, determined Jewish men and women have chosen to settle–or remain–in Europe after the devastation of the Holocaust, but they have paid a price. Among the unexpected dangers, they have had to cope with an alarming resurgence of Nazism in Europe, the spread of Arab terrorism, and the impact of the Jewish state on European life. Delving into the intimate stories of European Jews from all walks of life, Kurlansky weaves together a vivid tapestry of individuals sustaining their traditions, and flourishing, in the shadow of history. An inspiring story of a tenacious people who have rebuilt their lives in the face of incomprehensible horror, A Chosen Few is a testament to cultural survival and a celebration of the deep bonds that endure between Jews and European civilization. “Consistently absorbing . . .

With 1968, Mark Kurlansky brings to teeming life the cultural and political history of that world-changing year of social upheaval. People think of it as the year of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Yet it was also the year of the Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy assassinations; the riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago; Prague Spring; the antiwar movement and the Tet Offensive; Black Power; the generation gap, avant-garde theater, the birth of the women\'s movement, and the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union. From New York, Miami, Berkeley, and Chicago to Paris, Prague, Rome, Berlin, Warsaw, Tokyo, and Mexico City, spontaneous uprisings occurred simultaneously around the globe. Everything was disrupted. In the Middle East, Yasir Arafat\'s guerrilla organization rose to prominence ... both the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Biennale were forced to shut down by protesters ... the Kentucky Derby winner was stripped of the crown for drug use ... the Olympics were a disaster, with the Mexican government having massacred hundreds of students protesting police brutality there ... and the Miss America pageant was stormed by feminists carrying banners that introduced to the television-watching public the phrase "women\'s liberation." Kurlansky shows how the coming of live television made 1968 the first global year. It was the year that an amazed world watched the first live telecast from outer space, and that TV news expanded to half an hour. For the first time, Americans watched that day\'s battle--the Vietnam War\'s Tet Offensive--on the evening news. Television also shocked the world with seventeen minutes of police clubbing demonstrators at the Chicago convention, live film of unarmed students facing Soviet tanks in Czechoslovakia, and a war of starvation in Biafra. The impact was huge, not only on the antiwar movement, but also on the medium itself. The fact that one now needed television to make things happen was a cultural revelation with enormous consequences.… (more)', 'characters': ['Robert F. Kennedy', 'Richard M.

They seemed like the perfect couple—young, good-looking, made for each other. The moment Pauline, a stranger to the Polish Eastern Avenue neighborhood of Baltimore (though she lived only twenty minutes away), walked into his mother’s grocery store, Michael was smitten. And in the heat of World War II fervor, they are propelled into a hasty wedding. But they never should have married. Pauline, impulsive, impractical, tumbles hit-or-miss through life; Michael, plodding, cautious, judgmental, proceeds deliberately. While other young marrieds, equally ignorant at the start, seemed to grow more seasoned, Pauline and Michael remain amateurs. In time their foolish quarrels take their toll. Even when they find themselves, almost thirty years later, loving, instant parents to a little grandson named Pagan, whom they rescue from Haight-Ashbury, they still cannot bridge their deep-rooted differences. Flighty Pauline clings to the notion that the rifts can always be patched. To the unyielding Michael, they become unbearable. From the sound of the cash register in the old grocery to the counterculture jargon of the sixties, from the miniskirts to the multilayered apparel of later years, Anne Tyler captures the evocative nuances of everyday life during these decades with such telling precision that every page brings smiles of recognition.

Some fool who got himself infected with a flesh-eating bacteria is lurching around, trying to munch on folks’ brains. Joe hates shamblers, but he’s still the one who has to deal with them. That’s just the kind of life he has. Except afterlife might be better word. From the Battery to the Bronx, and from river to river, Manhattan is crawling with Vampyres. Joe is one of them, and he’s not happy about it. Yeah, he gets to be stronger and faster than you, and he’s tough as nails and hard to kill. But spending his nights trying to score a pint of blood to feed the Vyrus that’s eating at him isn’t his idea of a good time. And Joe doesn’t make it any easier on himself. Going his own way, refusing to ally with the Clans that run the undead underside of Manhattan–it ain’t easy. It’s worse once he gets mixed up with the Coalition–the city’s most powerful Clan–and finds himself searching for a poor little rich girl who’s gone missing in Alphabet City. Now the Coalition and the girl’s high-society parents are breathing down his neck, anarchist Vampyres are pushing him around, and a crazy Vampyre cult is stalking him. No time to complain, though. Got to find that girl and kill that shambler before the whip comes down . . . and before the sun comes up.… (more)', 'characters': ['Joe Pitt', 'Daniel', 'Evie', 'Dexter Predo', 'Tom Nolan', 'Lydia Miles', 'Terry Bird', 'Daniel', 'Amanda Horde', 'Marilee Horde', 'Dale Edward Horde', 'Sela'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780345478955': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2300682', 'Members': '679', 'Reviews': '10', 'Popularity': '25,082', 'Average rating': '(3.65)', 'Mentions': '39', 'summary': '"Without Anne Tyler, American fiction would be an immeasurably bleaker place."NEWSDAYEvie Decker is a shy, slightly plump teenager, lonely and silent.

Lucas envisioned a swashbuckling SF saga inspired by the Flash Gordon serials classic American westerns, the epic cinema of Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa, and mythological heroes. Its original title: The Star Wars. The rest is history, and how it was made is a story as entertaining and exciting as the movie that has enthralled millions for thirty years-a story that has never been told as it was meant to be. Until now. Using his unprecedented access to the Lucasfilm Archives and its trove of never-before-published "lost" interviews, photos, production notes, factoids, and anecdotes, Star Wars scholar J. W. Rinzler hurtles readers back in time for a one-of-a-kind behind-the-scenes look at the nearly decade-long quest of George Lucas and his key collaborators to make the "little" movie that became a phenomenon. For the first time, it\'s all here: * the evolution of the now-classic story and characters-including "Annikin Starkiller" and "a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills" named Han Solo * excerpts from George Lucas\'s numerous, ever-morphing script drafts * the birth of Industrial Light & Magic, the special-effects company that revolutionized Hollywood filmmaking * the studio-hopping and budget battles that nearly scuttled the entire project * the director\'s early casting saga, which might have led to a film spoken mostly in Japanese-including the intensive auditions that won the cast members their roles and made them legends * the grueling, nearly catastrophic location shoot in Tunisia and the subsequent breakneck dash at Elstree Studios in London * the who\'s who of young film rebels who pitched in to help-including Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma But perhaps most exciting, and rarest of all, are the interviews conducted before and during production and immediately after the release of Star Wars-in which George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, composer John Williams, effects masters Dennis Muren, Richard Edlund, and John Dykstra, Phil Tippett, Rick Baker, legendary production designer John Barry, and a host of others share their fascinating tales from the trenches and candid opinions of the film that would ultimately change their lives. No matter how you view the spectrum of this thirty-year phenomenon, The Making of Star Wars stands as a crucial document-rich in fascination and revelation-of a genuine cinematic and cultural touchstone.… (more)', 'characters': ['George Lucas', 'Kenny Baker', 'John Barry', 'Jeremy Bulloch', 'Anthony Daniels', 'Carrie Fisher', 'Harrison Ford', 'Alec Guinness', 'Mark Hamill', 'James Earl Jones', 'Irvin Kershner', 'Gary Kurtz', 'Joe Johnston', 'Alan Ladd', 'Peter Mayhew', 'Ralph McQuarrie', 'Frank Oz', 'David Prowse', 'Billy Dee Williams', 'John Williams'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780345495815': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1422292', 'Members': '35', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '551,358', 'Average rating': '(3.9)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "Celebrate the fortieth anniversary of Star Trek® with the original mission logs chronicling some of the crew's most bizarre missions and strangest encounters with alien races across the galaxy . . . where no man has gone before(tm).

Levi breaks his book into eight essays, ranging from topics like the unreliability of memory to how violence twists both the victim and the victimizer.

He also debunks the myth that most of the Germans were in the dark about the Final Solution or that Jews never attempted to escape the camps.

That question is: "How could the Holocaust happen?" His own response is a new exploration of those who carried out the Holocaust and of German society and its ingrained anti-semitism - and it demands a fundamental revision of our thinking about the years 1933-1945.Drawing principally on materials either unexplored or neglected by previous scholars, Goldhagen marshals new, disquieting, primary evidence - including extensive testimony from the actual perpetrators themselves - to show that many beliefs about the killers are fallacies: They were not primarily SS men or Nazi Party members, but perfectly ordinary Germans from all walks of life, men (and women) who brutalized and murdered Jews both willingly and zealously.And they did so, moreover, not because they were coerced (for, as he shows irrefutably, so many were informed by their own commanders that they could refuse to kill without fear of retribution)...not because they slavishly followed orders (a view seemingly supported by Stanley Milgram\'s famous Yale "obedience experiment")...not because of any tremendous social, psychological, or peer pressure to conform to the behaviour of their comrades (for no such evidence exists)...and not for any reasons associated with Hannah Arendt\'s disputed notion of the "banality of evil." They acted as they did because of a widespread, profound, unquestioned, and virulent antisemitism that led them to regard the Jews as a demonic enemy whose extermination was not only necessary but also just.Again and again, it is the killers\' own words that give us a portrait, both shocking and immediate, of their world: the organization of their daily lives, how they did what they did, their reactions to it, even their recreations in the killings fields, which included everything from sports and entertainment to the hobby of taking snapshots of their deeds and victims - to be freely exchanged and collected among themselves - leaving a devastating record of self-indictment that the author reproduces here.All of Goldhagen\'s documentary evidence is set within a fresh analysis of the phenomenon of German antisemitism itself, which revises many conventional views. He shows that it was already deep-rooted and pervasive in German society before Hitler came to power, and that there was a widely shared view that the Jews ought to be eliminated in some way from German society. When Hitler, ultimately, chose mass extermination as the only "final solution," he was thus easily able to enlist vast numbers of Germans to carry it out.… (more)', 'characters': ['Adolf Hitler', 'Wolfgang Hoffmann'], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (General Nonfiction, 1996)', "Time Magazine's Best Books of the Year (1996.4|Non-fiction (2), 1996)", 'New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 1996)']}, '9780349110011': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/23037', 'Members': '4,187', 'Reviews': '69', 'Popularity': '2,083', 'Average rating': '(4.16)', 'Mentions': '118', 'summary': "A collection of keen observations, witty analyses, and essays on a wide range of subjects exposes the fault lines in today's society.", 'characters': ['David Lynch', 'Michael Joyce', 'David Foster Wallace', 'Native Companion', 'Scott Peterson'], 'awards_and_honors': ["NPR's Complete Holiday Book Recommendations (2008)", "NPR's Best Picture Books (2008)"]}, '9780349111889': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/7436', 'Members': '3,108', 'Reviews': '52', 'Popularity': '3,182', 'Average rating': '(3.76)', 'Mentions': '63', 'summary': 'A collection of 23 stories, several of which deal with misunderstandings between men and women.

It begins with Agamemnon, which describes Agamemnon's return from the Trojan War and his murder at the hands of his wife Clytemnestra, continues with her murder by their son Orestes in Libation Bearers, and concludes with Orestes' acquittal at a court founded by Athena in Eumenides. The trilogy thus traces the evolution of justice in human society from blood vengeance to the rule of law, Aeschylus' contribution to a Greek legend steeped in murder, adultery, human sacrifice, cannibalism, and endless intrigue. This new translation is faithful to the strangeness of the original Greek and to its enduring human truth, expressed in language remarkable for poetic intensity, rich metaphorical texture, and a verbal density that modulates at times into powerful simplicity.

This biography describes a man of magnetic personality who counted Saul Bellow, Langston Hughes, Robert Penn Warren, Richard Wright, Richard Wilbur, Albert Murray, and John Cheever among his closest friends; a man whose life and art were shaped mainly by his unyielding desire to produce magnificent art and by his resilient faith in the moral and cultural strength of America.--From publisher description.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times Notable Book of the Year (Non-Fiction, 2007)', 'National Book Award finalist (2007.2|Nonfiction, 2007)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (Biography, 2007)', 'Commonwealth Club of California Book Awards (Nonfiction, Gold, 2007)', 'BCALA Book Award (Nonfiction, 2008)']}, '9780375411724': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/591556', 'Members': '153', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '137,263', 'Average rating': '(4.25)', 'Mentions': '1', 'summary': "Written over a period of more than half a century, these stories reflect every aspect of Tolstoy's art and personality.

The Nobel Prize-winning writer's masterwork is the engrossing story of a Muslim family in Cairo during Britain's occupation of Egypt in the early decades of the twentieth century. The novels of The Cairo Trilogy trace three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence. Palace Walk introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons - the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad's rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in Palace of Desire, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. Sugar Street brings Mahfouz's vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the ageing patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician. Throughout the trilogy, the family's trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries.

But it is also a major landmark on the map of self-inflicted death. Since 1965, some five hundred people have ended their lives by jumping or driving or simply walking off the 535-foot cliffs, making Beachy Head one of the most popular suicide spots in the world. And still they come, every week another one or two–the young and the old, the terminally ill and the vigorously healthy, the bereft, the insane, the despairing. Why here? Why so many? One chilly English spring, American writer and teacher Tom Hunt left his home and family and journeyed to this bucolic landscape to find out. In a narrative that seamlessly weaves together personal memoir, history, travelogue, and investigative journalism, Hunt recounts a season of disturbing revelations (including that Princess Diana allegedly came here intending to jump). Still reeling from a suicide in his own family, Hunt arrives in England obsessed with Beachy Head’s grisly mystique, yet utterly unsure of what he would discover. Gradually, with typical English reserve, the people who haunt this extraordinary place release their secrets. Servers in the local tavern–known among residents as the Last Stop Pub–whisper about their encounters with hollow-eyed men and women in their final hours. The celebrated local witch asserts his belief that the place was once used for human sacrifice. The kindly coroner provides access to suicide notes, photographs, and the Sudden Death file. “It’s a very cold solution,” confides a wheelchair-bound ex-hippie who miraculously survived his own jump. In the course of wrenching interviews with bereft family members, watchful taxi drivers, and brave rescue workers, it dawns on Hunt that in each of us is a will to die every bit as tenacious and unyielding as the desire to live–and that Beachy Head stiffens and heightens this death wish. It’s a stage that all but begs to be leapt from. A work of terrible sadness and harrowing revelations, Cliffs of Despair is the account of an unforgettable journey to a place where beauty and death collide.

Her easy-to-prepare adaptations shatter the myth that the Bard’s primary fare was boiled mutton. In fact, Shakespeare and his contemporaries dined on salads of fresh herbs and vegetables; fish, fowl, and meats of all kinds; and delicate broths. Dried Plums with Wine and Ginger-Zest Crostini, Winter Salad with Raisin and Caper Vinaigrette, and Lobster with Pistachio Stuffing and Seville Orange Butter are just a few of the delicious, aromatic, and gorgeous dishes that will surprise and delight. Segan’s delicate and careful renditions of these recipes have been thoroughly tested to ensure no-fail, standout results. The tantalizing Renaissance recipes in Shakespeare’s Kitchen are enhanced with food-related quotes from the Bard, delightful morsels of culinary history, interesting facts on the customs and social etiquette of Shakespeare’s time, and the texts of the original recipes, complete with antiquated spellings and eccentric directions. Fifty color images by award-winning food photographer Tim Turner span the centuries with both old-world and contemporary treatments.

A hundred years ago geisha numbered eighty thousand; today there are a thousand at most. Happily, Jodi Cobb is able to show us--before they vanish--both the ceremonial world of the geisha in Tokyo and Kyoto and their private world as few outsiders have ever seen it. Many of the older women we meet here were forced into this world by hardship; the young women were drawn to it by their dream of a romantic life or their love of traditional arts. We see geisha in their daytime routines: fine-tuning their breathtakingly lavish wardrobes; perfecting the art of makeup; training maikos (apprentices); and preparing for annual dance performances. But as we watch the geisha at night, as they entertain (for huge sums) at private parties, their art takes a different form. Their purpose is to provide a dream--of luxury, romance and exclusivity. As the men sit at dinner, geisha position themselves at their elbows to serve them sake and delicacies and practice a brilliantly honed art of conversation. As the alcohol flows and the guests relax, geisha play party tricks and sing songs. Geisha have for centuries studied the male ego. They tend it like a garden--and we watch men bloom. This long-hidden world is revealed here both in superlative photographs and in a fascinating text that includes the voices of the geisha themselves.

Forster, and posthumous by some forty years - still feels triumphant; why he, more than any other American writer, has captured the imaginative, social, and political concerns of successive generations; and why Ahab and the White Whale, after more than a century and a half, have become durably resounding symbols not only here but around the world."--BOOK JACKET.… (more)', 'characters': ['Herman Melville'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Lionel Trilling Book Award (2006)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist (Biography, 2005)']}, '9780375703065': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/17735', 'Members': '1,708', 'Reviews': '30', 'Popularity': '7,485', 'Average rating': '(3.51)', 'Mentions': '31', 'summary': "When Blinking Jack Stokes met Ruby Pitt Woodrow, she was twenty and he was forty.

Archie-working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt-is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin.  When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie\'s car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.  Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teeth is the story of two North London families-one headed by Archie, the other by Archie\'s best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal.  Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair.  Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for "no problem").  Samad-devoutly Muslim, hopelessly "foreign"-weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union.  They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd.  The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire\'s worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.  Zadie Smith\'s dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute.

They murdered more than 1.5 million men, women, and children between 1941 and 1943, often by shooting them into killing pits, as at Babi Yar. These massive crimes have been generally overlooked or underestimated by Holocaust historians, who have focused on the gas chambers.

In the thirties and forties, along with Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock, he became a key figure in the revolutionary American movement of abstract expressionism. Of all the painters in that group, he worked the longest and was the most prolific, creating powerful, startling images well into the 1980s. The first major biography of de Kooning captures both the life and work of this complex, romantic figure in American culture. Ten years in the making, and based on previously unseen letters and documents as well as on hundreds of interviews, this is a fresh, richly detailed, and masterful portrait. The young de Kooning overcame an unstable, impoverished, and often violent early family life to enter the Academie in Rotterdam, where he learned both classic art and guild techniques. Arriving in New York as a stowaway from Holland in 1926, he underwent a long struggle to become a painter and an American, developing a passionate friendship with his fellow immigrant Arshile Gorky, who was both a mentor and an inspiration. During the Depression, de Kooning emerged as a central figure in the bohemian world of downtown New York, surviving by doing commercial work and painting murals for the WPA. His first show at the Egan Gallery in 1948 was a revelation. Soon, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess were championing his work, and de Kooning took his place as the charismatic leader of the New York school--just as American art began to dominate the international scene. Dashingly handsome and treated like a movie star on the streets of downtown New York, de Kooning had a tumultuous marriage to Elaine de Kooning, herself a fascinating character of the period. At the height of his fame, he spent his days painting powerful abstractions and intense, disturbing pictures of the female figure--and his nights living on the edge, drinking, womanizing, and talking at the Cedar bar with such friends as Franz Kline and Frank O\'Hara. By the 1960s, exhausted by the feverish art world, he retreated to the Springs on Long Island, where he painted an extraordinary series of lush pastorals. In the 1980s, as he slowly declined into what was almost certainly Alzheimer\'s, he created a vast body of haunting and ethereal late work. This is an authoritative and brilliant exploration of the art, life, and world of an American master.… (more)', 'characters': ['Willem De Kooning'], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Critics Circle Award (Biography/Autobiography, 2004)', 'Pulitzer Prize (2005.4|Biography or Autobiography, 2005)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize (2004.09|Biography, 2004)', 'New York Times Best Books of the Year (2005)', 'Ambassador Book Award (2005.3|Biography/Autobiography, 2005)']}, '9780375713347': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/5127', 'Members': '5,434', 'Reviews': '150', 'Popularity': '1,425', 'Average rating': '(4.01)', 'Mentions': '256', 'summary': 'Aloysious and Lillian Binewski, proprietors of a traveling carnival, attempt to reduce overhead by breeding their own freak show, with tragic results.', 'characters': ['Olympia Binewski', 'Lillian Hinchcliff Binewski', 'Aloysius Binewski', 'Arturo Binewski', 'Electra Binewski', 'Iphigenia Binewski', 'Fortunato "Chick" Binewski', 'Miranda Barker', 'Norval Sanderson', 'Mary T.

Rhodes shows us young Audubon arriving in New York from France in 1803, his illegitimacy a painful secret, speaking no English but already drawing and observing birds. We see him falling in love, marrying the wellborn English girl next door, crossing the Appalachians to frontier Kentucky to start a new life, fashioning himself into an American just as his adopted country was finding its identity. Here is Audubon exploring the wilderness of birds-pelicans wading the shallows of interior rivers, songbirds flocking, passenger pigeons darkening the skies-and teaching himself to revivify them in glorious life-size images. Now he finds his calling: to take his hundreds of watercolor drawings to England to be engraved in a great multivolume work called The Birds of America. Within weeks of his arrival there in 1826, he achieves remarkable celebrity as "the American Woodsman." He publishes his major work as well as five volumes of bird biographies enhanced by his authentic descriptions of pioneer American life. Audubon\'s story is an artist\'s story but also a moving love story. In his day, communications by letter across the ocean were so slow and uncertain that John James and his wife, Lucy, almost lost each other in the three years when the Atlantic separated them-until he crossed the Atlantic and half the American continent to claim her. Their letters during this time are intimate, moving, and painful, and they attest to an enduring love. We examine Audubon\'s legacy of inspired observation-the sonorities of a wilderness now lost, the brash life of a new nation just inventing itself-precisely, truthfully, lyrically captured. And we see Audubon in the fullness of his years, made rich by his magnificent work, winning public honor: embraced by writers and scientists, feted by presidents and royalty. Here is a revelation of Audubon as the major American artist he is.

Herman and Noam Chomsky show that, contrary to the usual image of the news media as cantankerous, obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and defense of justice, in their actual practice they defend the economic, social, and political agendas of the privileged groups that dominate domestic society, the state, and the global order.  Based on a series of case studies-including the media\'s dichotomous treatment of "worthy" versus "unworthy" victims, "legitimizing" and "meaningless" Third World elections, and devastating critiques of media coverage of the U.S. wars against Indochina-Herman and Chomsky draw on decades of criticism and research to propose a Propaganda Model to explain the media\'s behavior and performance.  Their new introduction updates the Propaganda Model and the earlier case studies, and it discusses several other applications.  These include the manner in which the media covered the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent Mexican financial meltdown of 1994-1995, the media\'s handling of the protests against the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund in 1999 and 2000, and the media\'s treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation.  What emerges from this work is a powerful assessment of how propagandistic the U.S. mass media are, how they systematically fail to live up to their self-image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world, and how we can understand their function in a radically new way.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['Guardian 100 Greatest Non-Fiction (69|Politics)', 'Berkeley Summer Reading (2006)']}, '9780375714627': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/61153', 'Members': '354', 'Reviews': '6', 'Popularity': '54,975', 'Average rating': '(4.39)', 'Mentions': '4', 'summary': 'Here is the incomparable cast of the DC Comics universe: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman, the Green Lantern, and the rest of the Justice League as you\'ve never seen them before.

The award-winning designer/writer Chip Kidd and photographer Geoff Spear have teamed up to create a book like no other, with an introduction by M. Night Shyamalan, the acclaimed director of Signs and The Sixth Sense. Ross has often been called "the Norman Rockwell of comics," and this book reveals not only his lifelong love of these classic super heroes but also his vision: Mythology takes you into the studio for a behind-the-scenes look at his fascinating creative process. The combination of Ross\'s dynamic art and Kidd\'s kinetic design make images from his most memorable stories-including Kingdom Come, Superman: Peace on Earth, Batman: War on Crime, and Uncle Sam-soar off the more than 280 pages. There are also hundreds of never-before-seen sketches, limited edition prints, and prototype sculptures. Vintage DC comic panels are interspersed throughout, as reference points from which Ross launches his extraordinary interpretations. And most exciting for Ross fans, inside is a DC Comics first: an exclusive, original Superman-Batman story, written by Kidd and painted by Ross.

The strips–which were shot only from the original art or vintage newsprint–reveal how, from the 1950s through 2000, Schulz's style and the Peanuts world evolved.

In 1995, Adam Gopnik, his wife, and their infant son left the familiar comforts and hassles of New York City for the urbane glamour of the City of Light. For Gopnik this was above all a personal pilgrimage to the undisputed capital of everything cultural and beautiful. So, in the grand tradition of the American abroad, Gopnik walked the paths of the Tuileries, enjoyed philosophical discussions at his local bistro, and wrote as violet twilight fell on the arrondissements. Yet, at the end of the day, there was still the matter of raising a child and carrying on with the day-to-day, not-so-fabled life. As Gopnik describes, the dual processes of navigating a foreign city and becoming a parent are not completely dissimilar journeys-both hold new routines, new languages, a new set of rules by which everyday life is lived.

In "The botany of desire", Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires: sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulop, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind\'s most basic yearnings. And just as we\'ve benefited from these plants, the plants have also benefited at least as much from their association with us.

Center stage was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who with his Fourteen Points seemed to promise to so many people the fulfillment of their dreams. Stern, intransigent, impatient when it came to security concerns and idealistic in his dream of a League of Nations that would resolve all future conflict peacefully, Wilson is only one of the characters who fill the pages of this book. David Lloyd George, the British prime minister, brought Winston Churchill and John Maynard Keynes. Lawrence of Arabia joined the Arab delegation. Ho Chi Minh, a kitchen assistant at the Ritz, submitted a petition for an independent Vietnam. For six months, Paris was effectively the center of the world as the peacemakers carved up bankrupt empires and created new countries. This book brings to life the personalities, ideals, and prejudices of the men who shaped the settlement. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China, and dismissed the Arabs. They struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews. The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; above all they failed to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made the scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. She refutes received ideas about the path from Versailles to World War II and debunks the widely accepted notion that reparations imposed on the Germans were in large part responsible for the Second World War.… (more)', 'characters': ['Woodrow Wilson', 'David Lloyd George', 'Georges Clemenceau', 'Vittorio Orlando', 'Hermann Müller', 'John Maynard Keynes', 'League of Nations', 'Billy Hughes', 'Ho Chi Minh'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times Best Books of the Year (2002)', 'CBA Libris Award (Non-Fiction Book of the Year, 2003)', "Governor General's Literary Award (Non-fiction, 2003)", 'Charles Taylor Prize finalist (2004)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-fiction (2002)', 'Duff Cooper Prize (2001)', 'Arthur Ross Book Award (2003.2|Silver Medal, 2003)', 'Lionel Gelber Prize Shortlist (2003)', 'New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 2003)', 'Hessell-Tiltman Prize (2002)', "Prix Jean-Michel Gaillard des Rendez-vous de l'Histoire (2007)"]}, '9780375760648': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/995', 'Members': '23,765', 'Reviews': '378', 'Popularity': '104', 'Average rating': '(4.26)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '27 / 2373', 'summary': 'Often called the greatest novel ever written, War and Peace is at once an epic of the Napoleonic Wars, a philosophical study, and a celebration of the Russian spirit.

Savage Beauty is the portrait of a passionate, fearless woman who obsessed American ever as she tormented herself. If F. Scott Fitzgerald was the hero of the Jazz Age, Edna St. Vincent Millay, as flamboyant in her love affairs as she was in her art, was its heroine. The first woman ever to win the Pulitzer Prize, Millay was dazzling in the performance of herself. Her voice was likened to an instrument of seduction and her impact on crowds, and on men, was legendary. Yet beneath her studied act, all was not well. Milford calls her book "a family romance"--for the love between the three Millay sisters and their mother was so deep as to be dangerous. As a family, they were like real-life Little Women, with a touch of Mommie Dearest. Nancy Milford was given exclusive access to Millay\'s papers, and what she found was an extraordinary treasure. Boxes and boxes of letter flew back and forth among the three sisters and their mother--and Millay kept the most intimate diary, one whose ruthless honesty brings to mind Sylvia Plath.

She watched drug companies stray from their original mission of discovering and manufacturing useful drugs and instead become vast marketing machines with unprecedented control over their own fortunes. She saw them gain nearly limitless influence over medical research, education, and how doctors do their jobs. She sympathized as the American public, particularly the elderly, struggled and increasingly failed to meet spiraling prescription drug prices. Now, in this bold, hard-hitting new book, Dr. Angell exposes the shocking truth of what the pharmaceutical industry has become–and argues for essential, long-overdue change. Currently Americans spend a staggering $200 billion each year on prescription drugs. As Dr. Angell powerfully demonstrates, claims that high drug prices are necessary to fund research and development are unfounded: The truth is that drug companies funnel the bulk of their resources into the marketing of products of dubious benefit. Meanwhile, as profits soar, the companies brazenly use their wealth and power to push their agenda through Congress, the FDA, and academic medical centers. Zeroing in on hugely successful drugs like AZT (the first drug to treat HIV/AIDS), Taxol (the best-selling cancer drug in history), and the blockbuster allergy drug Claritin, Dr. Angell demonstrates exactly how new products are brought to market. Drug companies, she shows, routinely rely on publicly funded institutions for their basic research; they rig clinical trials to make their products look better than they are; and they use their legions of lawyers to stretch out government-granted exclusive marketing rights for years. They also flood the market with copycat drugs that cost a lot more than the drugs they mimic but are no more effective. The American pharmaceutical industry needs to be saved, mainly from itself, and Dr. Angell proposes a program of vital reforms, which includes restoring impartiality to clinical research and severing the ties between drug companies and medical education. Written with fierce passion and substantiated with in-depth research, The Truth About the Drug Companies is a searing indictment of an industry that has spun out of control.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780375802430': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/415761', 'Members': '422', 'Reviews': '4', 'Popularity': '44,841', 'Average rating': '(3.58)', 'Mentions': '2', 'summary': 'When Mr. and Mrs. Bird discover a strange egg in their nest they try to hatch it.', 'characters': ['Mr. Bird', 'Mrs. Bird', 'Junior'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780375806704': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/6320', 'Members': '14,220', 'Reviews': '391', 'Popularity': '299', 'Average rating': '(4.31)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '2 / 418', 'summary': 'A journey through a land where Milo learns the importance of words and numbers provides a cure for his boredom.', 'characters': ['Milo', 'Tock', 'Humbug', 'King Azaz', 'Alec Bings', 'Mathemagician', 'Rhyme', 'Reason', 'Faintly Macabre', 'Senses Taker', 'Canby', 'Terrible Dinn', 'Dr Dischord', 'Officer Shrift'], 'awards_and_honors': ["Waterstones The Nation's Favourite Children's Books (1997, No 81)", "1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up (2009.0545|2009, Ages 8↑)", 'Harvard Bookstore Top 100 (46)', "Parents' Choice Book Award (2011)", "William Allen White Children's Book Award Nominee (1964.1|1963-1964)", 'School Library Journal Top 100 Children’s Novels, 2010 Poll (10)', "School Library Journal Top 100 Children's Novels, 2012 Poll (21)", 'MSRI/CBC Mathical Books for Kids from Tots to Teens (2016.8|Hall of Fame Book, 2016)', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)', 'Reading the world in 196 books (USA)']}, '9780375812934': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/6641929', 'Members': '18', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '950,818', 'Average rating': '(4)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'The Jurassic Park Institute is an absolutely accurate way for kids to get excited about dinosaur science!

Melody must survive in worlds unknown and alien to her and she does that where others fail when her aura augments her skills and abilities. The book opens with the discovery that Andromeda, the enemy galaxy of the first novel, has discovered the secret of involuntary hosting: a Kirlian aura that is sufficiently stronger than that of an individual can take possession of that individual. Andromeda has secretly infiltrated the highest levels of government in Sphere Sol and its allies and resurrect its plot to steal the energy of the Milky Way. Melody of Mintaka, a direct descendant of Flint of Outworld and his Andromedan nemesis, has a Kirlian aura of well over two hundred. She is pressed into service to "possess" and interrogate a captured Andromedan transferee. Melody, hosted in the young and beautiful body of Yael of Dragon, must, like her progenitor Flint, find a way to defeat the Andromedan threat and save the galaxy. The mysterious Ancients are present again in the form of their artifacts and sites.

Dr. George Smoot, distinguished cosmologist and adventurer, whose quest for cosmic knowledge had taken him from the Brazilian rain forest to the South Pole unveiled his momentous discovery, bringing to light the very nature of the universe. For anyone who has ever looked up at the night sky and wondered, for anyone who has ever longed to pull aside the fabric of the universe for a glimpse of what lies behind it. Wrinkles in Time is the story of Smoot\'s search to uncover the cosmic seeds of the universe.\nWrinkles in Time is the Double Helix of cosmology, an intimate look at the inner world of men and women who ask. "Why are we here?" It tells the story of George Smoot\'s dogged pursuit of the cosmic wrinkles in the frozen wastes of Antarctica, on mountaintops, in experiments borne aloft aboard high-altitude balloons, U-2 spy planes, and finally a space satellite.\nWrinkles in Time presents the hard science behind the structured violence of the big bang theory through breathtakingly clear, lucid images and meaningful comparisons. Scientists and nonscientists alike can follow with rapt attention the story of how, in a fiery creation, wrinkles formed in space ultimately to become stars, galaxies, and even greater delicate structures. Anyone can appreciate the implications of a universe whose end is written in its beginnings - whose course developed according to a kind of cosmic DNA, which guided the universe from simplicity and symmetry to ever-greater complexity and structure. As controversial as it may seem today, Wrinkles in Time reveals truths that, in an earlier century, would have doomed its proclaimers to the fiery stake. For four thousand years some people have accepted the Genesis account of cosmic origin; for most of this century, scientists debated two rival scientific explanations known as the steady state and big bang theories.

Meet man as he really is: relative to the apes, stripped of his veneer as we see him courting, making love, sleeping, socialising, grooming, playing. Zoologist Desmond Morris's classic takes its place alongside Darwin's Origin of the Species, presenting man not as a fallen angel, but as a risen ape, remarkable in his resilience, energy and imagination, yet an animal nonetheless, in danger of forgetting his origins. With its penetrating insights on man's beginnings, sex life, habits and our astonishing bonds to the animal kingdom, The Naked Ape is a landmark, at once provocative, compelling and timeless.

But Elizabeth, who has comforted so many, has lost her heart to the one man who cannot reciprocate, even when she moves into his home to share his bed and raise his child. Then Lauren Denniker, Elizabeth’s adopted daughter, begins to display a miraculous gift--just as Elizabeth learns that she herself is unable to have a child. How Elizabeth comes to free herself from a loveless relationship, grapple with Lauren’s astonishing abilities, and come to terms with her own emptiness is the compelling heart of this remarkable tale.

Drifting through the night, whisper-quiet, they were the most sublime manifestations of a desperate enemy: Japanese balloon bombs. Made of rice paper, at once ingenious and deadly, they sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific, and once they started landing, the U.S. scrambled teams to find and defuse them, and then keep them secret from an already anxious public. Eighteen-year-old Louis Belk was one of those men. Dispatched to the Alaskan frontier, young Sergeant Belk was better trained in bomb disposal than in keeping secrets. And the mysteries surrounding his mission only increased when he met his superior officer-a brutal veteran OSS spy hunter who knew all too well what the balloons could do-and Lily, a Yup'ik Eskimo woman who claimed she could see the future. Louis's superior ushers him into a world of dark secrets; Lily introduces Louis to an equally disorienting world of spirits-and desire. But the world that finally tests them all is Alaska, whose vastness cloaks mysteries that only become more frightening as they unravel. Chasing after the ghostly floating weapons, Louis embarks upon an adventure that will lead him deep into the tundra. There, on the edge of the endless wilderness, he will make a discovery and a choice that will change the course of his life. At once a heart-quickening mystery and a unique love story, The Cloud Atlas is also a haunting, lyrical rendering of a little-known chapter in history.

Every year millions of Americans celebrate St. Patrick\'s Day, but they may not be aware of how great an influence St. Patrick was on the subsequent history of civilization. Not only did he bring Christianity to Ireland, he instilled a sense of literacy and learning that would create the conditions that allowed Ireland to become "the isle of saints and scholars" -- and thus preserve Western culture while Europe was being overrun by barbarians. In this entertaining and compelling narrative, Thomas Cahill tells the story of how Europe evolved from the classical age of Rome to the medieval era. Without Ireland, the transition could not have taken place. Not only did Irish monks and scribes maintain the very record of Western civilization -- copying manuscripts of Greek and Latin writers, both pagan and Christian, while libraries and learning on the continent were forever lost -- they brought their uniquely Irish world-view to the task. As Cahill delightfully illustrates, so much of the liveliness we associate with medieval culture has its roots in Ireland. When the seeds of culture were replanted on the European continent, it was from Ireland that they were germinated. In the tradition of Barbara Tuchman\'s A Distant Mirror, How The Irish Saved Civilization reconstructs an era that few know about but which is central to understanding our past and our cultural heritage. But it conveys its knowledge with a winking wit that aptly captures the sensibility of the unsung Irish who relaunched civilization.… (more)', 'characters': ['Augustus Caesar', 'Alaric', 'Saint Patrick', 'Medb'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780385418867': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/6493', 'Members': '6,657', 'Reviews': '59', 'Popularity': '1,073', 'Average rating': '(4.18)', 'Mentions': '64', 'summary': "Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell discuss the themes and roots of human myth which is seen as man's attempt to relate himself to the universe.

A compendium of 101 culturally significant particulars from the fields of mythology, religion, literature, history, science, mathematics, art, and music, "What Are the 7 Wonders of the World?" is a stimulating fusion of facts and fun that makes for an invaluable reference and an entertaining diversion. Questions are grouped in sections according to the number of items in their answer (all the 3s, all the 4s, all the 5s, etc.), so that the answers are in the form of easily memorized lists. You won\'t find Luther\'s 95 theses, or the 264 Popes, for example, but you will find everything from the 3 sons of Adam and Eve all the way up to the 24 letters of the ancient Greek alphabet. This clever format lends itself well to quizzing and guessing, which gives it a deliciously sophisticated parlor-game quality. But for those who wish to delve a little deeper, there are thoughtful essays to go with each answer that include fascinating details and place the list in its larger cultural or historical context. Much more than a book of trivia, "What Are the 7 Wonders of the World?" offers a grand overview of the knowledge needed to appreciate many of the finest things in our cultural and intellectual life.

Whole and colorful lives were devoted, and even sacrificed, to finding a proof. Leonhard Euler, the greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, had to admit defeat. Sophie Germain took on the identity of a man to do research in a field forbidden to females, and made the most significant breakthrough of the nineteenth century. The dashing Evariste Galois scribbled down the results of his research deep into the night before venturing out to die in a duel in 1832. Yutaka Taniyama, whose insights would ultimately lead to the solution, tragically killed himself in 1958. On the other hand, Paul Wolfskehl, a famous German industrialist, claimed Fermat had saved him from suicide, and established a rich prize for the first person to prove the theorem. And then came Princeton professor Andrew Wiles, who had dreamed of proving Fermat\'s Last Theorem ever since he first read of it as a boy of ten in his local library. In 1993, some 356 years after Fermat\'s challenge, and after seven years of working in isolation and secrecy - "a kind of private and very personal battle I was engaged in"--Wiles stunned the world by announcing a proof, though his own journey would be far from over.

When Jon Krakauer reached the summit of Mt. Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were in a desperate struggle for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated. Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people - including himself - to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eye-witness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.… (more)", 'characters': ['Jon Krakauer', 'Rob Hall', 'Scott Fischer', 'Andy Harris', 'Anatoli Boukreev', 'Beck Weathers'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times Best Books of the Year (1997)', 'Pulitzer Prize finalist (1998.6|General Non-Fiction, 1998)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (General Nonfiction, 1997)', 'Alex Award (1998)', "Time Magazine's Best Books of the Year (1997.5|Non-fiction (1), 1997)", 'ALA Best Books for Young Adults (1998)', 'New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 1997)', 'Salon Book Award (Nonfiction, 1997)', 'ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (1999.4|Non-fiction, 1999)', 'Extreme Classics: The 100 Greatest Adventure Books of All Time (009)', 'ALA Notable Books for Adults (1998)', 'Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award (1998)', "The Essential Man's Library: 100 Must-Read Books", "The Essential Man's Library: 50 Non-Fiction Adventure Books", 'Publishers Weekly Bestseller (Nonfiction, 1997)', 'Boardman Tasker Prize for mountain literature shortlist (1997)', 'Banff Mountain Book Festival (Mountain Literature, 1997)', 'ALA Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults (2015.04|Narrative Non-Fiction: Inspired by Actual Events, 2015)', 'TLA Tayshas High School Reading List (2000|1999-2000)', 'Garden State Teen Book Award (2000.3|Nonfiction, 2000)', 'NCTE Books For You: An Annotated Booklist for Senior High (2001|14th Edition: 1997-1999)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist (Current Interest, 1997)', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)']}, '9780385495172': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/59200', 'Members': '551', 'Reviews': '1', 'Popularity': '32,558', 'Average rating': '(3.96)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': '"Evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller shows the evolutionary power of sexual choice and the reasons why our ancestors became attracted not only to pretty faces and healthy bodies, but to minds that were witty, articulate, generous, and conscious.

B. Cooper's daring hijacking and its aftermath, by one of the toughest, most distinctive voices in American fiction.On the day before Thanksgiving 1971, just as a Seattle-bound 727 from Portland, Oregon, was taking off, a man calling himself D. B. Cooper handed a note to a flight attendant that said: “I have a bomb in my briefcase.” Touching down in Washington State, where airline officials and FBI agents met his demands—$200,000 and several parachutes—the passengers were released, and Cooper ordered the pilot to chart a course for Mexico City. But somewhere over the dense Pacific Northwest woods, Cooper jumped. No trace of him was ever found.This gutsy exploit made D. B. Cooper a legend and a folk hero, and it is the starting point for Elwood Reid's powerful examination of ways of living in America. Reid poses the question: Is it better to do one great thing in life or to grind out a righteous life? In Reid's version, D. B. Cooper is a Vietnam vet named Fitch, a man fed up with the timid course of his life and determined to do something about it. By pulling off the hijacking, he proves to himself that he is a man of destiny, capable of greatness. Or so it seems. He floats across the border to Mexico, drifting and lounging in the company of similar refugees and flotsam from the 1970s counterculture.In a parallel narrative, newly retired FBI Agent Frank Marshall has been cut adrift and now faces decades of purposelessness. Tempted to embark on an affair with a female witness he's been protecting, bored by leisure, and haunted by cases he couldn't solve, Frank agrees to help an eager young agent to look into the still-open D. B. Cooper case.When Fitch/Cooper, after years of cunning, exile, and silence, makes the mistake of falling for the wrong woman in Mexico, he is forced to return to America and the scene of his crime, and the two narratives intersect.The clean, taut prose that has become Reid's hallmark and his profound understanding of what work means and what the dream of escaping work really entails, makeD.B. a unique and profound work of fiction.… (more)", 'characters': ['Dan Cooper', 'Frank Marshall'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780385503846': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1139033', 'Members': '2,068', 'Reviews': '69', 'Popularity': '5,750', 'Average rating': '(3.62)', 'Mentions': '148', 'summary': "Ten interrelated stories tracing the course of Atwood's life and the lives intertwined with it.", 'characters': ['Tig', 'Nell', 'Lizzie', 'Oona', 'Lillie'], 'awards_and_honors': ['International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award Longlist (2008)']}, '9780385503952': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2348', 'Members': '23,726', 'Reviews': '590', 'Popularity': '105', 'Average rating': '(3.93)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '1 / 1146', 'summary': "On the hottest day of the summer of 1934, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her sister Cecilia strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house.

A Twain literary sleuth and an authority on children\'s literature, he considers all the literary, social, historical, and autobiographical aspects of Twain\'s classic tale of Huck and Jim\'s trip down the mighty Mississippi. In lively and fascinating annotations, Hearn\'s notes draw on everything from letters, manuscripts, and contemporary newspapers to the author\'s own frequent revisions and notes, various critical responses to the publication, and much previously unpublished material. The substantial introduction is, in essence, a mini-biography of a book and a man whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), and it recounts the novel\'s remarkably prickly history, resulting in its being banned perhaps more than any other work in American history." "In this new edition, the characters of Hannibal, Missouri, come vividly alive, as if Hearn was steering the raft itself. We encounter, among others, the kindhearted Widow Douglas, the dreaded Miss Watson; the enlightened runaway slave Jim, whom Huck meets on Jackson\'s Island; an endless parade of thieves, slaveowners, and sheer opportunists; as well as Tom Sawyer and Aunt Sally, whose desire to adopt and "sivilize" Huck propels him to flee to the American West. Likewise, the Mississippi River "emerges as a living force regardless of the vain attempts of men to tame it." Hearn, by illustrating literary and historical themes that we never knew before, demonstrates that Huckleberry Finn did more than merely redefine the "bad-boy\'s book"; it galvanized and transformed world literature."--Jacket.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['CCBC Choices (1981.12|Noteworthy New Editions of Classic Novels, 1981)']}, '9780393040586': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/3172305', 'Members': '34', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '565,226', 'Average rating': 'None', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "Raising confident, motivated, and caring children is a parent's greatest challenge.

Now, in a refutation of Baldwin, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and his coeditor, Hollis Robbins, affirm the literary transcendence of Harriet Beecher Stowe\'s 1852 masterpiece. As Gates and Robbins underscore, there has never been a single work of fiction that had a greater effect on American history than Uncle Tom\'s Cabin." "Expanding on recent scholarship and providing a new, African-American perspective, Gates and Robbins discuss how Baldwin got it wrong, and that "the time seems right for a reassessment both of the novel and of James Baldwin\'s critique, itself by now a part of the canon." Deciding to reprint the entire Stowe text, they reinvigorate this classic American story, allowing the modern reader to understand how entrenched racism came to distort both our perception of the characters as well as the meaning of the original novel." "New readers will be moved by the story of Eliza Harris, the young slave mother who escapes from the Shelby plantation in Kentucky to avoid being sold away from her child, but they will also learn how Stowe had to "whiten" the character of Eliza in order to offset Eliza\'s marital sexuality. In retracing Tom\'s stoic journey from Kentucky to the grand mansion of Augustine St. Clare in New Orleans, to Simon Legree\'s hellish plantation, we will also watch as generations of illustrators simultaneously emasculated the character of Tom in his scenes with Little Eva, while underscoring his inner strength as he\'s whipped by Legree and dies a martyr\'s death." "Gates and Robbins have compiled a comprehensive set of images that span the entire published history of the book. Original woodcuts and illustrations, advertisements, cartoons, rare prints, posters, paintings, photographs, and movie stills show the pervasive influence of Uncle Tom\'s Cabin on American history and pop culture.".\n"Along with these images and the introductory essay, Gates and Robbins have richly edited the original text with hundreds of annotations illuminating life in the South during nineteenth-century slavery, the abolitionist movement and the influential role played by devout Christians, the life story of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the Underground Railroad, Stowe\'s literary motives, her writing methods, and the novel\'s wide-ranging impact on the American public."--BOOK JACKET.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780393059953': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/3475', 'Members': '4,725', 'Reviews': '39', 'Popularity': '1,731', 'Average rating': '(3.61)', 'Mentions': '37', 'summary': 'During the summer of 1929, Freud worked on what became this seminal volume of twentieth-century thought.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['Harenberg Buch der 1000 Bücher', 'ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher (83)', "Christianity Today's Books of the Century", 'International Sociological Association: 1000 most influential books in Sociology (116)', 'The New Lifetime Reading Plan With Going Further (98.3)']}, '9780393060416': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/39409', 'Members': '3,146', 'Reviews': '26', 'Popularity': '3,130', 'Average rating': '(3.56)', 'Mentions': '22', 'summary': 'Final report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States.', 'characters': ['Osama bin Laden'], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Award finalist (2004.2|Nonfiction, 2004)', 'ALA Notable Books for Adults (2005)', 'Amazon.com Best Books (2004)', 'Books of the Decade: The 50 books that defined the decade (2000)', 'ALA Notable Government Documents (2004)', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)', 'The Economist Best Books (2004.16)', 'Audie Award Finalist (Achievement in Production, 2005)']}, '9780393060911': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1114337', 'Members': '170', 'Reviews': '5', 'Popularity': '123,075', 'Average rating': '(3.52)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'There was a turning point in Michael Lewis\'s life, in a baseball game when he was fourteen years old.

That memory is often expressed in the symptomatology of posttraumatic stress disorder-nightmares, flashbacks, startle responses, and dissociative behaviors. In essence, the body of the traumatized individual refuses to be ignored.While reducing the chasm between scientific theory and clinical practice and bridging the gap between talk therapy and body therapy, Rothschild presents principles and non-touch techniques for giving the body its due. With an eye to its relevance for clinicians, she consolidates current knowledge about the psychobiology of the stress response both in normally challenging situations and during extreme and prolonged trauma.

Written centuries before the time of Shakespeare and even Chaucer,The Tale of Genji marks the birth of the novel--and after more than a millennium, this seminal work continues to enchant readers throughout the world. Lady Murasaki Shikibu and her tale\'s hero, Prince Genji, have had an unmatched influence on Japanese culture. Prince Genji manifests what was to become an image of the ideal Heian era courtier; gentle and passionate. Genji is also a master poet, dancer, musician and painter.The Tale of Genji follows Prince Genji through his many loves and varied passions. This book has influenced not only generations of courtiers and samurai of the distant past, but artists and painters even in modern times--episodes in the tale have been incorporated into the design of kimonos and handicrafts, and the four-line poems calledwaka which dance throughout this work have earned it a place as a classic text in the study of poetry. This version by Kencho Suematsu was the first-ever translation in English. Condensed, it\'s a quarter length of the unabridged text, making it perfect for readers with limited time.

Taking the reader from the drama of Jefferson Davis's resignation from the United States Senate and Abraham Lincoln's arrival in the nation's capital to Davis's final flight and capture and Lincoln's tragic death, Foote covers his subject with astonishing depth and scope. Every battle, every general, and every statesman has its place in this monumental narrative, told in lively prose that captures the sights, smells, and sounds of the conflict. Never before have the great battles and personalities of the Civil War been so excitingly presented, and never before has the story been told so completely.

More astute and forbearing, yet more fallible than legend has allowed, Wilde is given here the dimensions of a modern hero. Based on fresh material from many hitherto-untapped sources, Ellmann depicts Wilde\'s comet-like ascent on the Victorian scene and his equally dramatic sudden eclipse. His Irish background, the actresses to whom he paid court, his unfortunate wife and lovers, his clothes, coiffures, and the decor of his rooms - all are presented here in vivid detail. The saga of his 1882 American tour is recounted with a wealth of new details; also his later impact on the bastions of the French literary establishment. The London of the Nineties, of Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelites, Lillie Langtry and the Prince of Wales, is evoked alongside Paris of the "belle epoque" and the Greece, Italy and North Africa of Wilde\'stravels. Ellmann\'s definitive critical account of Wilde\'s entire oeuvre shows him as the proponent of a radical new aesthetic who was perilously at odds with Victorian society. After his period of success and daring, the fatal love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas is followed by exposure, imprisonment, a few wretched years abroad and death in exile. The tragic end of Wilde\'s life leaves the reader with a sense of compassion and grief for the protagonist.

It sees him first at the pinnacle of his power, leader of a victorious Britain. In July 1945 at Potsdam, Churchill, Stalin, and Truman aimed to shape postwar Europe. But while still grappling with world issues Churchill returned to Britain for the general election results and was thrown out of office. For six years Churchill worked to restore the fortunes of Britain\'s Conservative Party, while at the same time warning the world of Communist ambitions, urging the reconciliation of France and Germany, pioneering the concept of a united Europe, and seeking to maintain the closest possible links between Britain and the United States. His aim throughout was to achieve not confrontation with the Soviet Union but conciliation based firmly upon Western strength and unity. In October 1951 Churchill became prime minister for the second time. The Great Powers were at peace but under the shadow of a fearful new weapon, the hydrogen bomb. Hoping, after the election of Eisenhower in 1952 and the death of Stalin in 1953, for a fresh start in East-West relations, Churchill worked for a new summit conference, but in April 1955 ill health and pressure from colleagues forced him to resign. In retirement Churchill traveled widely, took up painting again, completed the four-volume History of the English-Speaking Peoples, and watched as world conflicts continued, still convinced that they could be resolved by statesmanship. "Never despair" remained his watchword, and his faith, until the end. That end came slowly, for those nearest to him it was a sad decline. Yet almost to his ninetieth year he was able to follow events with hope and faith in the ability of man to survive his own folly.… (more)', 'characters': ['Winston Churchill'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780395500767': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/53736', 'Members': '1,252', 'Reviews': '13', 'Popularity': '11,347', 'Average rating': '(4.08)', 'Mentions': '30', 'summary': "Required reading for the hip generation, this one-volume edition contains two novels and a collection of poetry.

Michael Reed is living a posthumous life. In spite of outward appearances -- he holds a respectable university teaching position; he is an articulate and attractive addition to local social life -- he\'s a dead man walking. Nothing can touch Reed, nothing can move him, although he observes with a mordant clarity the lives whirling vigorously around him. Of his recent bereavement, nearly four years earlier, he observes, "I\'m speaking as I\'d speak of a change in the earth\'s climate, or the recent war." Facing the unwelcome end of his temporary stint at the university, Reed finds himself forced "to act like somebody who cares what happens to him. " Tentatively he begins to let himself make contact with a host of characters in this small academic town, souls who seem to have in common a tentativeness of their own.

Breaking with the prevailing picture of existentialism and phenomenology at the time, it has become one of the landmark works of twentieth-century thought. This new translation, the first for over fifty years, makes this classic work of philosophy available to a new generation of readers. Phenomenology of Perception stands in the great phenomenological tradition of Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. Yet Merleau-Ponty¿s contribution is decisive, as he brings this tradition and other philosophical predecessors, particularly Descartes and Kant, to confront a neglected dimension of our experience: the lived body and the phenomenal world. Charting a bold course between the reductionism of science on the one hand and "intellectualism" on the other, Merleau-Ponty argues that we should regard the body not as a mere biological or physical unit, but as the body which structures one¿s situation and experience within the world. Merleau-Ponty enriches his classic work with engaging studies of famous cases in the history of psychology and neurology as well as phenomena that continue to draw our attention, such as phantom limb syndrome, synaesthesia, and hallucination. This new translation includes many helpful features such as the reintroduction of Merleau-Ponty¿s discursive Table of Contents as subtitles into the body of the text, a comprehensive Translator¿s Introduction to its main themes, essential notes explaining key terms of translation, an extensive Index, and an important updating of Merleau-Ponty¿s references to now available English translations.

The winner of over 350 races, he was champion jockey in 1953/1954 and rode for HM Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, most famously on Devon Loch in the 1956 Grand National. On his retirement from the saddle, he published his autobiography, The Sport of Queens, before going on to write forty-three bestselling novels, a volume of short stories (Field of 13), and the biography of Lester Piggott. During his lifetime Dick Francis received many awards, amongst them the prestigious Crime Writers' Association's Cartier Diamond Dagger for his outstanding contribution to the genre, and three 'best novel' Edgar Allan Poe awards from The Mystery Writers of America. In 1996 he was named by them as Grand Master for a lifetime's achievement. In 1998 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and was awarded a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List of 2000.

In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to Astounding magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre.

The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy.

Turow's multidimensional delving into his protagonists' psyches and his marvellous gift for suspense prefigure the achievements of his bestselling first novel, Presumed Innocent. Each September, a new crop of students enter Harvard Law School to begin an intense, often gruelling, sometimes harrowing year of introduction to the law.

Even more impressive are the faculty: Perini, the dazzling, combative professor of contracts, who presents himself as the students' antagonist in their struggle to master his subject; Zechman, the reserved professor of torts who seems so indecisive the students fear he cannot teach; and Nicky Morris, a young, appealing man who stressed the humanistic aspects of law. Will the One Ls survive? Will they excel? Will they make the Law Review, the outward and visible sign of success in this ultra-conservative microcosm?

Her new novel, set in the 1850s, speaks to us in a splendidly quirky voice--the strong, wry, no-nonsense voice of Lidie Harkness of Quincy, Illinois, a young woman of courage, good sense, and good heart. It carries us into an America so violently torn apart by the question of slavery that it makes our current political battlegrounds seem a peaceable kingdom. Lidie is hard to scare. She is almost shockingly alive--a tall, plain girl who rides and shoots and speaks her mind, and whose straightforward ways paradoxically amount to a kind of glamour. We see her at twenty, making a good marriage--to Thomas Newton, a steady, sweet-tempered Yankee who passes through her hometown on a dangerous mission. He belongs to a group of rashly brave New England abolitionists who dedicate themselves to settling the Kansas Territory with like-minded folk to ensure its entering the Union as a Free State. Lidie packs up and goes with him. And the novel races alongside them into the Territory, into the maelstrom of "Bloody Kansas," where slaveholding Missourians constantly and viciously clash with Free Staters, where wandering youths kill you as soon as look at you--where Lidie becomes even more fervently abolitionist than her husband as the young couple again and again barely escape entrapment in webs of atrocity on both sides of the great question. And when, suddenly, cold-blooded murder invades her own intimate circle, Lidie doesn\'t falter. She cuts off her hair, disguises herself as a boy, and rides into Missouri in search of the killers--a woman in a fiercely male world, an abolitionist spy in slave territory. On the run, her life threatened, her wits sharpened, she takes on yet another identity--and, in the very midst of her masquerade, discovers herself. Lidie grows increasingly important to us as we follow her travels and adventures on the feverish eve of the War Between the States. With its crackling portrayal of a totally individual and wonderfully articulate woman, its storytelling drive, and its powerful recapturing of an almost forgotten part of the American story, this is Jane Smiley at her enthralling and enriching best.

Welcome to Derry, Maine. It\'s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. Only in Derry the haunting is real. They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and happiness. But the promise they made twenty-eight years ago calls them reunite in the same place where, as teenagers, they battled an evil creature that preyed on the city\'s children. Now, children are being murdered again and their repressed memories of that terrifying summer return as they prepare to once again battle the monster lurking in Derry\'s sewers.

She knows that the Germans’ ability to thwart the Allied attack depends upon their lines of communications, and in the days before the invasion no target is of greater strategic importance than the largest telephone exchange in Europe. But when Flick and her Resistance-leader husband try a direct, head-on assault that goes horribly wrong, her world turns upside down. Her group destroyed, her husband missing, her superiors unsure of her, her own confidence badly shaken, she has one last chance at the target, but the challenge, once daunting, is now near impossible.

It is a dreamlike world of summertime and hooky, pranks and punishments, villains and desperate adventure, seen through the eyes of a very special boy. For adults it re-creates the vanished dreams of youth. For younger readers it unveils the boundaries of tantalizing horizons still to come. And for everyone, it reveals the heart and mind of one of America\'s greatly loved writers. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn - He has no mother, his father is a brutal drunkard, and he sleeps in a hogshead. He\'s Huck Finn, a homeless waif, a liar and thief on occasion, and a casual rebel against respectability. But on the day that he encounters a runaway slave named Jim, Huck also finds love, acceptance, and responsibility.

Marco Polo was the most famous traveller of his time. His voyages began in 1271 with a visit to China, after which he served the Kublai Khan on numerous diplomatic missions. On his return to the West he was made a prisoner of war and met Rustichello of Pisa, with whom he collaborated on this book. His account of his travels offers a fascinating glimpse of what he encountered abroad- unfamiliar religions, customs and societies; the spices and silks of the East; the precious gems, exotic vegetation and wild beasts of faraway lands. Evoking a remote and long-vanished world with colour and immediacy, Marco's book revolutionized western ideas about the then unknown East and is still one of the greatest travel accounts of all time. For this edition - the first completely new English translation of the Travels in over fifty years - Nigel Cliff has gone back to the original manuscript sources to produce a fresh, authoritative new version. The volume also contains invaluable editorial materials, including an introduction describing the world as it stood on the eve of Polo's departure, and examining the fantastical notions the West had developed of the East.… (more)", 'characters': ['Marco Polo', 'Maffeo Polo', 'Niccolo Polo', 'Kublai Khan', 'Rustichello da Pisa'], 'awards_and_honors': ["Borges' A Personal Library", 'Extreme Classics: The 100 Greatest Adventure Books of All Time (010)', '501 Must-Read Books (Travel Writing)', "The Essential Man's Library: 50 Non-Fiction Adventure Books", 'Books That Changed the World', "Philip Ward's Lifetime Reading Plan (Year 22)", 'Classics Revisited', 'Harenberg Buch der 1000 Bücher', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)', '100 Books That Shaped World History']}, '9780451529770': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/31129', 'Members': '13,424', 'Reviews': '226', 'Popularity': '323', 'Average rating': '(3.82)', 'Mentions': '422', 'summary': 'In 1872, English gentleman Phileas Fogg has many adventures as he tries to win a bet that he can travel around the world in eighty days.', 'characters': ['Phileas Fogg', 'Jean Passepartout', 'Fix', 'Francis Cromarty', 'Aouda', 'John Bunsby', 'William Batulcar', 'Stamp Proctor', 'William Hitch', 'John Sullivan', 'Samuel Fallentin', 'Gauthier Ralph', 'Thomas Flanagan', 'Andrew Stuart', 'Samuel Wilson'], 'awards_and_honors': ['1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006/2008/2010/2012 Edition)', 'IBBY Outstanding Book for Young People with Disabilities (2009.4|Special "easy-to-read" books, 2009)', 'Guardian 1000 (War and travel)', "1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up (2009.0748|2009, Ages 12↑)", 'Audie Winner (2006.17|Classics, 2006)', "The Essential Man's Library: 50 Fictional Adventure Books", "Western World's Greatest Books - Project Gutenberg", 'Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay (1956)', "Reader's Digest World's Best Reading (30)", '1000 лучших произведений мировой худ. литературы в русских переводах, рекомендованных для комплектования школьной библиотеки', '1001 böcker du måste läsa innan du dör', "Newark Public Library's 1904 List of a Thousand of the Best Novels", 'Les 100 livres préférés des Français (47)', 'Les meilleurs romans écrits ou traduits en français, selon les lecteurs de Livresse', '66 Bücher, von denen alle sagen, dass du sie gelesen haben musst']}, '9780451530042': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/7489', 'Members': '17,563', 'Reviews': '223', 'Popularity': '200', 'Average rating': '(4.09)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '4 / 1147', 'summary': "Charles Dickens' 1850 classic epic, David Copperfield, unfolds the story of David, an optimistic and hard-working lad who's orphaned in his youth.

Unpretentious and direct, Slavitt's translation preserves the innate verve and energy of the dramas, engaging the reader--or audience member--directly with Sophocles' great texts. Slavitt chooses to present the plays not in narrative sequence but in the order in which they were composed--Antigone, Oedipus Tyrannos, Oedipus at Colonus--thereby underscoring the fact that the story of Oedipus is one to which Sophocles returned over the course of his lifetime. This arrangement also lays bare the record of Sophocles' intellectual and artistic development. Renowned as a poet and translator, Slavitt has translated Ovid, Virgil, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Ausonius, Prudentius, Valerius Flaccus, and Bacchylides as well as works in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hebrew. In this volume he avoids personal intrusion on the texts and relies upon the theatrical machinery of the plays themselves.

Iris Courtney, who is white, is the only witness when handsome Jinx Fairchild, a black basketball player, kills a white man in order to protect her. The secret link between Iris and Jinx is not only their attraction to each other, but a bond of passion and guilt that has formed between them.

"Eighteenth-century France is the setting - a time and a place where age-old superstitions shadow an age of enlightenment, where the minuet of aristocratic life is deaf to the approaching drumbeats of revolution, where elegance masks depravity and licentiousness makes mockery of love. Against this background, Berthe Duvet, maid to Adele du Fourchet, later Mme la duchesse de Malvoeux, tells her tale of a doomed society and of a family seeking to break a terrible curse." "Berthe is an orphan child brought up in the green rooms of the Paris theatre when she enters the service of the beautiful young girl who is to be her lifelong mistress and charge. Her sharp eyes and sharper tongue record the intrigues and amours of a world of privilege and perversity, in which she and Adele must come of age in very different ways. Then, with Adele\'s marriage to the mysterious duc de Malvoeux, Berthe takes us to a place a world away from the Paris of Rousseau, du Barry and de Sade - the ducal chateau Beauxpres, hidden deep in the primitive Jura mountains of France, wolf-haunted, rooted in the memory of blood." "Into this realm of legends and dark sorceries comes a scorned beggar with a fearful prophecy. Unless the House of Malvoeux finds and possesses a fabulous porcelain dove, the noble family faces madness and ruin. Yet even as the quest for the dove begins, the members of the family follow their own destinies and desires. The duc retreats to his aviary; the duchesse into parties and flirtations. One son heeds the call of God; another is tempted by Satanic sensuality. And a daughter grows up to be both rebel and savior of the family, fulfilling the quest even as the storm of the French Revolution breaks." "Vivid in its recreation of a vanished age and delightfully iconoclastic in its view of women and history, this rare and exhilarating reading adventure is a triumph of the imagination."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In her first book of nonfiction, Julia Alvarez takes us behind the scenes and shares the lessons she\'s learned on her way to becoming an internationally acclaimed novelist. In 1960, when Alvarez was ten years old, her family fled the Dominican Republic. Her father participated in a failed coup attempt against the dictator Rafael Trujillo, and exile to the United States was the only way to save his life. The family settled in New York City, where Dr. Alvarez set up a medical practice in the Bronx while his wife and four daughters set about the business of assimilation--a lifelong struggle. Loss of her native land, language, culture, and extended family formed the thematic basis for two of Julia Alvarez\'s three best-selling novels--How The Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents and its sequel, Yo! Her father\'s revolutionary ties inspired In, The Time Of The Butterflies, her historical novel about one of Trujillo\'s most infamous atrocities. Something To Declare offers an extraordinary collection of essays that deal with the two big issues of Alvarez\'s life--growing up with one foot in each culture and writing. The twelve essays that make up "Customs," the first of two parts, examine the specific effects of exile on this writer. The essays are personal--how her maternal grandfather passed along his love of the arts, how the nuclear family-in-exile snuggled down every year to watch the Miss America contest from the parental bed, how Julia feared her family might disown her upon publication of her first novel. In the second half, "Declarations," are twelve essays about writing that range from confession of Alvarez\'s means of supporting her writing habit to the gritty details of her actual process. Every one of these essays is warm, open, honest, and generous.

Now, in an updated edition with fifty pages of new content, Rachel Simon reflects on changes in her life, Beth\'s life, and the lives of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The highlight is Beth\'s update, which is in her own words. A new Reader\'s Guide is also included. Join these two unforgettable sisters on their journey, this time in an even deeper and richer way. Rachel Simon\'s sister Beth is a spirited woman who lives intensely and often joyfully. Beth, who has an intellectual disability, spends her days riding the buses in her unnamed Pennsylvania city. The drivers, a lively group, are her mentors; her fellow passengers are her community. One day, Beth asks Rachel to accompany her on the buses for an entire year. This wise, funny, deeply affecting true story is the chronicle of that remarkable time. Rachel, a writer and college teacher whose hyperbusy life camouflaged her emotional isolation, had much to learn in her sister\'s extraordinary world. Full of life lessons from which any reader will profit, Riding the Bus with My Sister is "a heartwarming, life-affirming journey through both the present and the past...[that] might just change your life" (Boston Herald). Elegantly woven throughout the odyssey are riveting memories of terrifying maternal abandonment, fierce sisterly loyalty, and astonishing forgiveness.

Watching events unfold in the US and writing directly from Iraq, Christopher Hitchens cuts through the spin and slogans shaping popular through and tackles the fundamental questions. What was the true nature of Saddam's regime? Was this really Bush's war for oil? Was Blair principled or a poodle? Will our military action spark more terrorist attacks? Hitchens reports on the current crisis while at the same time emphasizing the historical perspective - that this war began when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, only a few months after the fall of the Berlin wall.

KGB files on Oswald and the JFK assassination that Boris Yeltsin almost certainly has no intention of showing President Clinton. The KGB’s attempts to discredit civil rights leader in the 1960s, including its infiltration of the inner circle of a key leader.

"Lawrence M. Friedman argues that the evolution of criminal justice has reflected transformations in America\'s character. Thus the theocratic world of seventeenth-century Puritanism generated a peculiar equation between crime and sin. The extraordinary geographic and social mobility of nineteenth-century America produced its own distinctive approach to crime and punishment. And the expressive individualism of the twentieth century encouraged an emphasis on "crimes of the self."" "Crime and Punishment in American History covers vast and fascinating terrain: the Salem witchcraft trials; the Red Scare after World War I; the rise of the American penitentiary; the emergence of the professional detective; the development of laws against fornication and gambling and the reform of rape laws; the rise of the insanity defense; the growth of a prisoners rights movement; and much more. It is about vigilantes, outlaws, embezzlers, swindlers, and what happened to them; about the growth of white-collar crime; and about revolutionary changes in the relationship between gender and criminal justice." "Informed by the perspective of the social sciences, this book is a social history of crime and punishment, the story of the social reaction to crime. Not a history of criminal law or an intellectual history of penology or a treatise on the philosophy of good and evil, this book chronicles the development of a working system of criminal justice, from arrest to trial to prison and punishment."

Indeed, three out of four Americans say they feel more fearful today than they did only a couple decades ago. But are we living in exceptionally perilous times? In his bestselling book The Culture of Fear, sociologist Barry Glassner demonstrates that it is our perception of danger that has increased, not the actual level of risk. Glassner exposes the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our fears: politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime and drug use even as rates for both are declining; advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases; TV shows that create a new scare every week to garner ratings. Glassner spells out the prices we pay for social panics: the huge sums of money that go to waste on unnecessary programs and products as well as time and energy spent worrying about our fears. All the while, we are distracted from the true threats, from climate change to worsening inequality. In this updated edition of a modern classic, Glassner examines the current panics over vaccination and "political correctness" and reveals why Donald Trump\'s fearmongering is so dangerously effective.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780465016907': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/25890', 'Members': '2,055', 'Reviews': '22', 'Popularity': '5,790', 'Average rating': '(3.95)', 'Mentions': '31', 'summary': 'The bestselling book on childhood trauma and the enduring effects of repressed anger and pain Why are many of the most successful people plagued by feelings of emptiness and alienation?
