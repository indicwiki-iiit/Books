The haunting short story, Leaf by Niggle, recounts the story of the artist, Niggle, who has 'a long journey to make' and is seen as an allegory of Tolkien's life. The poem Mythopoeia relates an argument between two unforgettable characters as they discuss the making of myths.

Douglas Coupland, the author whom Tom Wolfe calls "one of the freshest, most exciting voices of the novel today," delivers his tenth book in ten years of writing, with "All Families Are Psychotic." Coupland recently has been compared to Jack Kerouac and F. Scott Fitzgerald, yet he is a man firmly grounded in the current era. The novel is a sizzling and sharp-witted entertainment that resounds with eternal human yearnings. In the opening pages, 65-year-old Janet Drummond checks the clock in her cheap motel room near Cape Canaveral, takes her prescription pills and does a rapid tally of the whereabouts of her three children: Wade, the eldest, in and out of jail and still radiating "the glint"; suicidal Bryan, whose girlfriend, the vowel-free Shw, is pregnant; and Sarah, the family\'s shining light, an astronaut preparing to be launched into space as the star of a shuttle mission. They will all arrive in Orlando today - along with Janet\'s ex-husband Ted and his new trophy wife - setting the stage for the most disastrous family reunion in the history of fiction. Florida may never recover from their version of fun in the sun. The last time the family got together, there was gunplay and an ensuing series of HIV infections. Now, what should be a celebration turns instead into a series of mishaps and complications that place the family members in constant peril. When the reformed Wade attempts to help his dad out of a financial jam and pay off his own bills at the fertility clinic, his plan spins quickly out of control. Adultery, hostage-taking, a letter purloined from Princess Diana\'s coffin, heart attacks at Disney World, bankruptcy, addiction and black-market negotiations - Coupland piles on one deft, comic plot twist after another, leaving you reaching for your seat belt. When the crash comes, it is surprisingly sweet. Janet contemplates her family, and where it all went wrong. "People are pretty forgiving when it comes to other people\'s family. The only family that ever horrifies you is your own." During the writing, Coupland described the book as being about "the horrible things that families do to each other and how it makes them strong." He commented: "Families who are really good to each other, I\'ve noticed, tend to dissipate, so I wonder how awful a family would have to be to stick together." Coupland\'s first novel, "Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture," became a cultural phenomenon, affixing a buzzword and a vocabulary to a generation and going on to sell over a million copies. The novels that followed were all bestsellers, and his work has continued to show a fascination with the digital, brand-conscious, media-dense culture of contemporary North American society, leading some to peg him as "an up-to-the-minute cultural reference engine." Meanwhile, his deeper interests in how human beings function in this spiritual vacuum have become increasingly apparent. For example, the character Wade contemplates his father: "What "would" the world have to offer Ted Drummond, and the men like him, a man whose usefulness to the culture had vanished somewhere around the time of Windows 95? Golf? Gold? Twenty-four hour stock readouts?" Janet, on the other hand, nears a kind of peace with life: "Time erases both the best and the worst of us."

thought. The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Well Holmes, Jr., future associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea -- an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea. Holmes, James, and Peirce all believed that ideas are not things "out there" waiting to be discovered but are tools people invent -- like knives and forks and microchips -- to make their way in the world. They thought that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals -- that ideas are social. They do not develop according to some inner logic of their own but are entirely depend -- like germs -- on their human carriers and environment. And they thought that the survival of any idea not on its immutability but on its adaptability. The Metaphysical Club is written in the spirit of this idea about ideas. It is not a history of philosophy but an absorbing narrative about personalities and social history, a story about America. It begins with the Civil War and s in 1919 with Justice Holmes\'s dissenting opinion in the case of U.S. v. Abrams-the basis for the constitutional law of free speech. The first four sections of the book focus on Holmes, James, Peirce, and their intellectual heir, John Dewey. The last section discusses some of the fundamental twentieth-century ideas they are associated with. This is a book about a way of thinking that changed American life.… (more)', 'characters': ['Charles Sanders Peirce', 'Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.', 'William James', 'John Dewey', 'Louis Agassiz'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Pulitzer Prize (2002.3|History, 2002)', 'New York Times Best Books of the Year (2001)', 'Francis Parkman Prize (2002)', 'Heartland Prize (Non-Fiction, 2001)', 'Christian Science Monitor Best Book (2001)', 'Longman/History Today Book of the Year Shortlist (2003)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist (History, 2001)', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)', 'The Economist Best Books (2001.4)']}, '9780007127740': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2972', 'Members': '7,504', 'Reviews': '119', 'Popularity': '882', 'Average rating': '(3.99)', 'Mentions': '222', 'summary': "Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man is a kaleidoscopic blending of magic, imagination, and truth, widely believed to be one of the grand master's premier accomplishments.

While psychedelics of all sorts are demonized in America today, the visionary compounds found in plants are the spiritual sacraments of tribal cultures around the world. From the iboga of the Bwiti in Gabon, to the Mazatecs of Mexico, these plants are sacred because they awaken the mind to other levels of awareness--to a holographic vision of the universe. Breaking Open the Head is a passionate, multilayered, and sometimes rashly personal inquiry into this deep division. On one level, Daniel Pinchbeck tells the story of the encounters between the modern consciousness of the West and these sacramental substances, including such thinkers as Allen Ginsberg, Antonin Artaud, Walter Benjamin, and Terence McKenna, and a new underground of present-day ethnobotanists, chemists, psychonauts, and philosophers. It is also a scrupulous recording of the author's wide-ranging investigation with these outlaw compounds, including a thirty-hour tribal initiation in West Africa; an all-night encounter with the master shamans of the South American rain forest; and a report from a psychedelic utopia in the Black Rock Desert that is the Burning Man Festival. Breaking Open the Head is brave participatory journalism at its best, a vivid account of psychic and intellectual experiences that opened doors in the wall of Western rationalism and completed Daniel Pinchbeck's personal transformation from a jaded Manhattan journalist to shamanic initiate and grateful citizen of the cosmos.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780007149827': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/83916', 'Members': '9,346', 'Reviews': '398', 'Popularity': '593', 'Average rating': '(3.8)', 'Mentions': '579', 'summary': 'In a world in which Alaska, rather than Israel, has become the homeland for the Jews following World War II, Detective Meyer Landsman and his half-Tlingit partner Berko investigate the death of a heroin-addled chess prodigy.', 'characters': ['Meyer Landsman', 'Berko Shemets', 'Alter Litvak', 'Hertz Shemets', 'Bina Gelbfish', 'Aryeh Baronshteyn', 'Laurie Jo Bear', 'Dennis Brennan', 'Rudolph Buchbinder', 'Cashdollar', 'Wilfred Dick', 'Moish Fligler', 'Frum', 'Melekh Gaystick', 'Gold', 'Naomi Landsman', 'Max Roboy', 'Shprintzl Rudashevsky', 'Ester-Malke Shemets', 'Batsheva Shpilman', 'Heskel Shpilman', 'Mendel Shpilman', 'Spade', 'Katherine Sweeney', 'Tenenboym', 'Turteltoyb', 'Micky Vayner', 'Itzik Zimbalist'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 2007)', 'New York Times Notable Book of the Year (Fiction & Poetry, 2007)', 'Edgar Award Nominee (Novel, 2008)', 'Nebula (Novel, 2007)', 'British Science Fiction Association Award Shortlist (2007.1|Novel, 2007)', "SF Site Editor's Choice (2007)", 'Hugo (Novel, 2008)', 'Locus (2008.1|SF Novel, 2008)', 'Sidewise Award (Long Form, 2007)', 'John W.

Enthralling.' Peter Ackroyd, The Times The original transcript of the famous Wilde vs Queensberry trial, containing previously unseen details and exchanges. With extensive footnotes and a new introduction, this definitive account is a dramatic read that will delight Wilde enthusiasts and the general reader. One of the most famous love affairs in literary history is that of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas. When it became public, it cost Wilde everything. Merlin Holland has discovered the original courtroom transcript of the trial which led to his grandfather's tragedy. Here at last is the true record, without the distortions of previous accounts. On 18 February 1895 Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, delivered a note to the Albemarle Club addressed to 'Oscar Wilde posing as somdomite [sic]'. With Bosie's encouragement, Wilde decided to sue the Marquess for libel. As soon as the trial opened London's literary darling was at the centre of the greatest scandal of his time. Wilde's fall from grace was swift: his case lost, prosecution by the Crown soon followed, ending in the imprisonment that destroyed his health - even as his art, as Wilde put it, improved through 'suffering'. In this remarkable book we witness Wilde's confidence ebbing under the relentless questioning and see him lose track of the witty lines for which he was famous. Ultimately, it was his wit that betrayed him.… (more)", 'characters': ['Oscar Wilde', 'Lord Alfred Douglas'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780007158515': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/73092', 'Members': '3,617', 'Reviews': '47', 'Popularity': '2,580', 'Average rating': '(4.02)', 'Mentions': '15', 'summary': 'The Cat in the Hat takes Young Cat in tow to show him the fun he can get out of reading.', 'characters': ['The Cat in the Hat', 'Jake the Pillow Snake', 'Foo-Foo the Snoo'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780007158522': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/22982', 'Members': '9,174', 'Reviews': '360', 'Popularity': '614', 'Average rating': '(4.35)', 'Mentions': '61', 'summary': 'Advice in rhyme for proceeding in life; weathering fear, loneliness, and confusion; and being in charge of your actions.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 1990)', "1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up (2009.0333|2009, Ages 5↑)", 'NCTE Adventuring with Books: A Booklist for Pre-K—Grade 6 (1993|10th Edition: 1988-1992)']}, '9780007162994': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/106832', 'Members': '1,195', 'Reviews': '24', 'Popularity': '12,081', 'Average rating': '(3.84)', 'Mentions': '37', 'summary': "O'Brien's searing memoir of his years as a soldier in Vietnam takes readers with him through the ghostly ambiguities of manhood and morality in a war gone terribly wrong.", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['ALA Best Books for Young Adults (1973)']}, '9780007171996': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1386651', 'Members': '43,821', 'Reviews': '423', 'Popularity': '23', 'Average rating': '(4.52)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '2 / 1318', 'summary': "One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, The Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages, it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. From his fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, Sauron's power spread far and wide. He gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. On Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday, he disapeared, bequeathing to his young cousin, Frodo, the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. THE LORD OF THE RINGS tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of

and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.… (more)', 'characters': ['Morgoth Bauglir', 'Fëanor', 'Túrin Turambar', 'Beren', 'Lúthien Tinúviel', 'Ar-Adûnakhôr', 'Aegnor', 'Aerandir', 'Aerin (kinswoman of Húrin)', 'Amandil', 'Amarië', 'Amlach', 'Amras', 'Amrod', 'Anárion', 'Ancalagon', 'Angrim', 'Angrod', 'Annael', 'Aragorn II', 'Dior Eluchíl', 'Aranwë', 'Aratan', 'Aratar', 'Arathorn', 'Aredhel Ar-Feiniel', 'Ar-Gimilzôr', 'Arien', 'Ar-Pharazôn the Golden', 'Ar-Sakalthôr', 'Arthad', 'Aulë', 'Azaghâl', 'Baragund', 'Barahir', 'Baran', 'Beleg', 'Belegund', 'Bëor', 'Bereg', 'Bór', 'Borlach', 'Borlad', 'Boromir (first lord of Ladros)', 'Boron', 'Borthand', 'Brandir', 'Bregolas', 'Bregor', 'Brodda', 'Caranthir', 'Carcharoth', 'Celeborn', 'Celebrimbor', 'Celegorm', 'Círdan', 'Ciryon', 'Curufin', 'Daeron', 'Dagnir', 'Dairuin', 'Denethor (First Age)', 'Dior', 'Dorlas', 'Draugluin', 'Durin', 'Eärendil', 'Eärendur (lord of Andúnië)', 'Eärendur (10th King of Arnor)', 'Eärnil', 'Eärnur', 'Eärwen', 'Ecthelion', 'Edrahil', 'Eilinel', 'Varda Elentári', 'Elemmírë', 'Elendil', 'Elendur', 'Elenwë', 'Elrond Half-elven', 'Elros', 'Eluréd', 'Elurin', 'Elwë', 'Elwing', 'Emeldir', 'Eöl', 'Eönwë', 'Erellont', 'Eru', 'Estë', 'Falathar', 'Finarfin', 'Finduilas', 'Fingolfin', 'Fingon', 'Finrod Felagund', 'Finwë', 'Frodo Baggins', 'Fuinur', 'Galadriel', 'Galdor the Tall', 'Gandalf', 'Gelmir (Elf of Nargothrond)', 'Gelmir (Elf of Angrod)', 'Gildor Inglorion', 'Gimilkhâd', 'Glaurung', 'Glirhuin', 'Glóredhel', 'Glorfindel', 'Gorlim', 'Gothmog', 'Guilin', 'Gundor', 'Gwindor', 'Hador', 'Haldad', 'Haldan', 'Haldar', 'Haldir (First Age)', 'Haleth', 'Halmir', 'Handir', 'Hareth', 'Hathaldir', 'Hathol', 'Herumor', 'Huan', 'Hunthor', 'Huor', 'Húrin', 'Ibun', 'Idril', 'Ilmarë', 'Ilúvatar', 'Imlach', 'Indis', 'Ingwë', 'Inziladûn', 'Inzilbêth', 'Irmo', 'Isildur', 'Khîm', 'Lalaith', 'Lenwë', 'Lindórië', 'Lorgan', 'Mablung', 'Maedhros', 'Maeglin', 'Maglor', 'Magor', 'Mahtan', 'Malach', 'Manwë', 'Marach', 'Mardil Voronwë', 'Melian', 'Meneldil', 'Mîm', 'Míriel (Daughter of Tar-Palantir)', 'Míriel (first wife of Finwë)', 'Morwen [Tolkein]', 'Nahar', 'Námo', 'Nerdanel', 'Nessa [Tolkein]', 'Nienna [Tolkein]', 'Nienor [Tolkein]', 'Nimloth', 'Ohtar', 'Olórin', 'Olwë', 'Orodreth', 'Oromë', 'Ossë', 'Radagast the Brown', 'Radhruin', 'Ragnor [The Lord Of The Rings]', 'Rían', 'Rochallor', 'Rúmil of Tirion', 'Saeros', 'Salmar', 'Saruman the White', 'Sauron', 'Silmarien', 'Tar-Ancalimon', 'Tar-Atanamir', 'Tar-Elendil', 'Tar-Ciryatan', 'Tar-Minastir', 'Tar-Palantir', 'Telchar', 'Telemnar', 'Elu Thingol', 'Thorondor', 'Thranduil', 'Thuringwethil', 'Tilion', 'Tulkas', 'Tuor', 'Turgon', 'Túrin I', 'Uinen', 'Uldor', 'Ulfang', 'Ulfast', 'Ulmo', 'Ulwarth', 'Ungoliant', 'Urthel', 'Vairë', 'Valandil of Andúnië', 'Vána', 'Varda', 'Voronwë', 'Yavanna', 'Gildor (First Age)', 'Túrin II', 'Amroth'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Ditmar Award (International Fiction, 1978)', 'Gandalf Award (Book-length Fantasy, 1978)', 'Locus (1978.2|Fantasy Novel, 1978)', 'New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 1977)', 'Gigamesh (Fantasía, Novela, 1985)', 'Locus (Best Fantasy Novel, 1978)', 'ISFDB Top 100 Books -

Waking up in an L.A. hospital, John Johnson is amazed that it was the flu and not an overdose of five different drugs mixed with cognac that nearly killed him. As a producer of high-adrenaline action flicks, he\'s led a decadent and dangerous life, purchasing his way through every conceivable variant of sex. But each variation seems to take him one notch away from a capacity for love, and while movie-making was once a way for him to create worlds of sensation, it now bores him. After his near-death experience, John decides to walk away from his life. Susan Colgate is an unbankable former tv star and child beauty pageant contender. Forced to marry a heavy metal singer in need of a Green Card after her parents squander her sitcom earnings, she becomes the alpha road rat. But when the band\'s popularity dwindles, the marriage dissolves. Flying back to Los Angeles in Economy, Susan\'s plane crashes and only she survives. As she walks away from the disaster virtually unscathed, Susan, too, decides to disappear.

As Americans, we assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression. In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice--the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish--becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice--from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse. By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counter intuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['Business Week Top Ten Books of the Year', 'forbes.com Top Ten Books of the Year']}, '9780060009427': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/29255', 'Members': '3,491', 'Reviews': '79', 'Popularity': '2,702', 'Average rating': '(3.88)', 'Mentions': '145', 'summary': "What does it mean when a fictional hero takes a journey?.

The author of nine bestsellers--including the history-making Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus--John Gray expands on the expert advice touched upon in his previous books and distills each message into a powerful, inspiring daily meditation in this newest volume. There's no doubt about it: The relationship between men and women is extremely complex. We often forget just how different the sexes are, and become frustrated and confused by a loved one's behavior. Every day we need to be reminded of these differences and realize that it's okay to be different as long as we recognize and understand the behavior of the opposite sex. In Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days, John Gray provides us with daily inspirations that lovingly and insightfully remind us of the contrasts between Mars and Venus, allowing us to solve conflicts in our relationships. Each month is devoted to a single theme, with the daily meditations enlarging on the particular subject at hand. The topics correlate with the very traits of the month itself: January, an exhilarating time of new beginnings, inspires resolve and the desire to excel. In February, when we find ourselves deep in winter's grip and challenged by constant emotional upheaval, we seek reminders of the importance of commitment and the need for patience. May concentrates on such springtime issues as harmony and appreciation. The topics discussed are as diverse as relationships are. Inside you'll find comforting and helpful advice on: The true meaning of equality Improving communication Giving and receiving emotional support The awakening of our inner qualities Needing time alone Keeping the passion alive Reacting to stress Whether you need the thoughtful reminders yourself or know a friend or loved one who will benefit from these beautiful reflections, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days is a classic that no bookshelf should be without. The Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days contains 365 inspirations to remind you each day of the basic differences between men and women Women love a man with a plan; men love a woman with a smile. A woman is like a wave. When she feels loved, her self-esteem rises and falls like a wave in motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down. This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom, her mood will shift suddenly, and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically, her wave begins to rise back up...By recognizing this pattern, a man doesn't take it personally. When he doesn't feel as if he is being blamed for her downs, he can be more supportive. A rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle, which involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again...Most women are surprised to realize that even when a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer. Men instinctively feel this urge to pull away. It is not a decision or a choice. It just happens. It is neither his fault nor her fault. It is a natural cycle. Romance for women is when a man does things without her having to ask; romance for men is when a woman appreciates the things he does. Showing interest is one of the most important secrets to opening a woman's heart. A man is free to be the best he can be when he feels accepted just the way he is. Women need to work on trusting, while men need to work on caring.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060218058': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/55129', 'Members': '1,867', 'Reviews': '32', 'Popularity': '6,633', 'Average rating': '(4.18)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '1 / 23', 'summary': "With help from an eccentric professor who gives their imaginations special intensive training, three children succeed in locating the last of the great Whangdoodles and granting his heart's desire.", 'characters': ['Lindy Potter', 'Ben Potter', 'Tom Potter', 'Professor Savant', 'The Whangdoodle', 'The Prock'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Young Hoosier Book Award Nominee (1976-1977)']}, '9780060256579': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/150465', 'Members': '1,001', 'Reviews': '23', 'Popularity': '15,265', 'Average rating': '(4.27)', 'Mentions': '4', 'summary': 'A missing piece, looking for someone to carry it along, finally develops its own momentum.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060256753': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/8096', 'Members': '825', 'Reviews': '10', 'Popularity': '19,655', 'Average rating': '(4.15)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': "After leaving the jungle for the circus and a life of fame and wealth, a lion who taught himself to be the best shot in the world discovers he's not really a lion anymore, and not really a man, either.", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060277406': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2356948', 'Members': '34', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '565,226', 'Average rating': '(4.25)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'A compilation of recipes for foods served in England during the Victorian Era and inspired by characters and events in "The Secret Garden" by Frances Hodgson Burnett.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060278427': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/122402', 'Members': '216', 'Reviews': '5', 'Popularity': '95,242', 'Average rating': '(4.24)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': 'Photographs and mementos accompany an account of the life and literary career of the author of the well-loved "Little House" books.', 'characters': ['Laura Ingalls Wilder'], 'awards_and_honors': ['CCBC Choices (1998)']}, '9780060391539': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/438001', 'Members': '93', 'Reviews': '1', 'Popularity': '226,110', 'Average rating': '(3.08)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "With unflinching, often painful honesty, the sardonic, outspoken cohost of Howard Stern's nationally syndicated radio and cable TV show reveals the shocking facts of her childhood abuse.

Christian Europe, a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory, first on the battlefield and in the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of public and even private life." "In this volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed, how they had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy, education and culture. He describes how some Middle Easterners fastened blame on a series of scapegoats, both external and internal, while others asked, not "who did this to us?" but rather "where did we go wrong?" and, as a natural consequence, "how do we put it right?" Lewis highlights the striking differences between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries with thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil society, the clock and the calendar."--Jacket.… (more)', 'characters': ['Mustapha Kemal', 'Napoleon Bonaparte'], 'awards_and_honors': ['New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 2002)']}, '9780060518653': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/3381', 'Members': '2,445', 'Reviews': '33', 'Popularity': '4,509', 'Average rating': '(4.13)', 'Mentions': '94', 'summary': '"I have told you nothing about man that is not true."

That is, until the dead body of a female student from Heather's residence hall is discovered at the bottom of an elevator shaft.

Yet no one wants to listen, not the police, her colleagues, or the P.I. who owns the brownstone where she lives, even when more students start turning up dead in equally ordinary and subtly sinister ways. So Heather makes the decision to take on yet another new career: as spunky girl detective!

Their mission was "to proceed all the way to the end of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas" and unite the whole world in Confucian harmony. Their journey would last over two years and circle the entire globe. When they returned Zhu Di had fallen from power and China was beginning its long, self-imposed isolation from the world it had so recently embraced. The great ships rotted at their moorings and the records of their journeys were destroyed. Lost was the knowledge that Chinese ships had reached America 70 years before Columbus and circumnavigated the globe a century before Magellan.

In this historical detective story, he shares the account of his discoveries and the incontrovertible evidence to support them. His narrative brings together ancient maps, precise navigational knowledge, astronomy and the surviving accounts by Chinese explorers and the later European navigators.

For each of us, there is a connection between our early family dynamics and experiences and our current attitudes and decisions. Many of the people Dr. Laura has helped did not realize how their histories impacted their adult lives, or how their choices in people, repetitive situations, and decisions -- even their emotional reactions -- were connected to those early negative experiences, playing a major role in their current unhappiness. For these people and millions like them, too much time is dedicated to repeating the ugly dynamics of childhood in a vain attempt to repair or cope with deep hurt and longings. Too often they use their emotional pain to control others or excuse their own inappropriate and destructive behaviors. Some turn to therapy, only to find themselves trapped in their self-pitying victim mode, robbed of optimism, confidence, and growth. Dr. Laura will help you realize that no matter what circumstances you came from or currently live in, you are ultimately responsible for how you react to them. The acceptance of this basic truth is the source of your power to secure the Good Life you long for. In her signature straightforward style, with real-life examples, Dr. Laura shows you what you will gain by not being satisfied with an identity as a victim, or even as a survivor -- but striving to be a victor! In Bad Childhood -- Good Life, Dr. Laura will guide you to accept the truth of the assaults on your psyche and soul, understand your unique coping style and how it impacts your daily thoughts and actions, and help you embrace a life of more peace and happiness.

Jack Faber is one of them. The son of a struggling Louisiana sugar farmer, Faber is a young hotshot pitcher with an unhittable slider and rocket for a fastball. He plays for the fabled Seapuit Seawolves and dreams of making the Big Show, like many of his teammates: the catcher, Tony Garcia, fast-talking, irreverent prelaw student from Northwestern; Doughnut Davis, the erratic pitching phenom from the University of Georgia, who can throw a heat-seeking 93-mph screamer over the edge of the plate, followed by a 93-mph screamer over the umpire's head; the Citadel's slick officer cadet infielders, Rick Adams and Bobby Madison; the steel-armed outfielder, Ray Sweeney, son of a Maine fisherman; and the Sooner's first baseman, Zac Colbert, from Mickey Mantle's hometown of Spavinaw, Oklahoma. In the middle of it all, Jack's dad, Ben Faber, who can barely make ends meet on his bayou sugar farm, is falling in love with Garcia's mother, Natalie, the beautiful and penniless classical music teacher from the Chicago tenements. Their budding long-distance romance can hardly make it off the ground, as they can't travel and can't afford even a phone call. And their hopes for their sons are at odds: For Natalie, it is for Tony to get his act together-forget about this school yard game, go to law school and become a successful attorney. For Ben, it is for Jack to land a huge contract in the major leagues. Jack triumphantly becomes the Cape's MVP, but disaster awaits him when he returns to school in Louisiana. A new coach, the scowling Bruno Riazzi, a former pro catcher, resents the kid's celebrity status and decides he needs to knock him down a peg or two. And he'll stop at nothing to make it happen. Humiliated, Jack loses his lifelong art, and with it his passion for the game and, mysteriously, his ability to throw. His fastball has become tentative, his curve timid, and the beloved slider floats up to the plate like a volleyball. It has happened before to pros like Rick Ankiel and Mark Wohlers, brilliantly successful pitchers who suddenly lost it. A devastated Jack Faber is released from the St. Charles College roster. But the Seawolves coaches won't give up on him. They bring Jack back to Cape Marlin, determined to help him rediscover his lost talent.

A kind of vigorous supervisory humour is his natural idiom as a writer, and one particular attraction of his shorter work is the fresh further display it offers of this prime element in his literary character."… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060587031': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/45111', 'Members': '1,856', 'Reviews': '47', 'Popularity': '6,684', 'Average rating': '(4.1)', 'Mentions': '34', 'summary': 'After trading his father for two goldfish, a boy and his little sister go on a rollicking adventure around town to get him back.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ["Prix Ligue de l'Enseignement 41 pour le Jeune Public—bd BOUM (2000)", 'CCBC Choices (2005)']}, '9780060589288': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/8623', 'Members': '4,724', 'Reviews': '83', 'Popularity': '1,732', 'Average rating': '(3.53)', 'Mentions': '26', 'summary': 'After being tricked into moving to Geneva as a dancer, Maria must work as a prostitute.

Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. Drawing on his own journey from a naïve, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life--one not rooted in creed or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus's character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith.… (more)", 'characters': ['Jesus, of Nazareth "Christ"'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060609191': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/45972', 'Members': '1,081', 'Reviews': '16', 'Popularity': '13,812', 'Average rating': '(4.08)', 'Mentions': '4', 'summary': 'One of the vital challenges facing thoughtful people today is how to read the Bible faithfully without abandoning our sense of truth and history. Reading the Bible Again for the First Time provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined -- in an approach the author calls "historical-metaphorical." Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible\'s origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyone -- whatever one\'s religious background -- to engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060622138': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/65857', 'Members': '1,619', 'Reviews': '8', 'Popularity': '8,035', 'Average rating': '(4.03)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': '"More than inspirational reading: it belongs to the very heartbeat of evangelic witness." --Christianity Today \xa0 Shadow of the Almighty is one of the great missionary stories of modern times.\xa0It is the life and testament of Jim Elliot, as told by Elliot\'s widow, author and evangelist Elisabeth Elliot Gren.\xa0Shadow of the Almighty is the true account of\xa0Elliot\'s martyrdom, along with\xa0four fellow\xa0missionaries, at the hands of Ecuador\'s Huaorani Indians.\xa0About this important and enlightening book, Eugenia Price\xa0writes,"It proves that Jesus Christ will bring bright creativity out of any shadow which might fall across any life and any love."

In The Cat\'s Pajamas, this "latter-day O.

Here you will find stories strange and scary, nostalgic and bittersweet, humorous and heart-touching, ranging from the not-so-long-gone past to an unknowable future: a group of senators drinks a bit too much, and gambles away the United States; a newlywed couple buys an old house and finds their fledgling relationship tested; two mysterious strangers arrive at a rooming house and baffle their fellow occupants with strange crying in the night; a lonely woman takes a last chance on love. The final piece in the collection is a story-poem, a fond salute from Bradbury to his literary heroes Shaw, Chesterton, Dickens, Twain, Poe, Wilde, Melville, and Kipling.

She regally stalked the streets of Greenwich Village wearing a bustle with a flashing taillight, a brassiere made from tomato cans, or a birdcage necklace; declaimed her poems to sailors in beer halls; and enthusiastically modeled in the nude for artists such as Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp, setting the city ablaze with her antics. Before today's outsized celebrities, there was the Baroness -- poet and artist, proto-punk rocker, sexual libertine, fashion avatar, and troublemaker. At the center of the Dadaist circle, the Baroness transformed herself into a living, breathing work of art. Holy Skirts is a vivid imagining of the Baroness's story. Beginning in 1904, with Elsa's burlesque performance onstage in Berlin's Wintergarten cabaret, the adventures continue across Europe, through turbulent marriages and love affairs, until the Baroness finally lands in New York City, just before America enters the war. As she befriends Greenwich Village artists and writers, she defines herself as a poet, even as she breaks the bonds of female propriety. In a beautifully written novel, René Steinke paints an exquisite portrait of this woman and her time -- an era of cataclysmic change that witnessed brutal war, technological innovation, the rise of urban living, and an irrevocable shift in the lives of women, who, like Elsa, struggled to create their own destinies. Holy Skirts is a celebration of resilience and imagination, anexploration of the world in which the modern woman was born, and a testament to the lost bohemia.… (more)", 'characters': ['Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven', 'Man Rey', 'Marcel Duchamp'], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Award finalist (2005.1|Fiction, 2005)', 'Library of Virginia Literary Award finalist (Fiction, 2006)']}, '9780060782139': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2944782', 'Members': '131', 'Reviews': '1', 'Popularity': '160,829', 'Average rating': '(3.6)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "Butterflies There are 20,000 different kinds of butterflies in the world.

John "Red" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob, rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James "Whitey" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper, Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven, Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror, brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer, loan shark, money launderer, and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin, Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests, fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA. While Bulger\'s other top men turned informant to save their own hides, Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be, himself, a rat. For in the end, in a remarkable show of betrayal, Bulger turned out to be the FBI\'s "main man" and top informant -- tipping off the feds for decades while still managing to operate one of the most murderous and profitable organized crime outfits of all time. In Rat Bastards, Shea brings that mysterious world and gritty urban Irish American street culture into sharp focus by telling his own story -- of his fatherless upbringing, his apprenticeship on the tough streets of Southie, and his love affair with trouble, boxing, and then the gangster life. In prose that is refreshingly honest, personal, and surprisingly tender, Shea tells his harrowing, unflinching, and unapologetic story. A man who did the crime, did the time, and held fast to the Irish code of silence, which he was raised to follow at any cost, Shea remains a man of honor and in doing so has become a living legend. One of the last of a dying breed, a true stand-up guy. Shea expects no forgiveness and makes no excuses for the life he chose. His story is intense, compelling, and in your face.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060837334': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/473911', 'Members': '257', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '78,835', 'Average rating': '(3.78)', 'Mentions': '3', 'summary': "After 35 years in power, Henry VIII was a bloated, hideously obese, black-humoured old man, rarely seen in public.

It was increasingly obvious that when Henry died, real power in England would be exercised by a regent. The prospect of that prize spurred the rival court factions into deadly conflict.

"The legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa - the name has since become a byword for a cataclysmic disaster - was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. Beyond the purely physical horrors of an event that has only very recently been properly understood, the eruption changed the world in more ways than could possibly be imagined. Dust swirled round the planet for years, causing temperatures to plummet and sunsets to turn vivid with lurid and unsettling displays of light. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogota and Washington, D. C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island\'s destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away.

But hidden within the rituals of its creation is a fascinating and mysterious story - a story of two remarkable men whose strange twenty-year relationship lies at the core of this historic undertaking. Professor James Murray, an astonishingly learned former schoolmaster and bank clerk, was the distinguished editor of the OED project. Dr. William Chester Minor, an American surgeon from New Haven, Connecticut, who had served in the Civil War, was one of thousands of contributors who submitted illustrative quotations of words to be used in the dictionary. But Minor was no ordinary contributor. He was remarkably prolific, sending thousands of neat, handwritten quotations from his home in the small village of Crowthorne, fifty miles from Oxford. On numerous occasions Murray invited Minor to visit Oxford and celebrate his work, but Murray's offer was regularly - and mysteriously - refused. Thus the two men, for two decades, maintained a close relationship only through correspondence. Finally, in 1896, after Minor had sent nearly ten thousand definitions to the dictionary but had still never traveled from his home, a puzzled Murray set out to visit him. It was then that Murray finally learned the truth about Minor - that, in addition to being a masterful wordsmith, Minor was also a murderer, clinically insane - and locked up in Broadmoor, England's harshest asylum for criminal lunatics.… (more)", 'characters': ['William Chester Minor', 'James Murray (Sir)'], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (General Nonfiction, 1998)', 'New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 1998)', 'Salon Book Award (Nonfiction, 1998)']}, '9780060840884': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/876898', 'Members': '540', 'Reviews': '18', 'Popularity': '33,363', 'Average rating': '(3.79)', 'Mentions': '22', 'summary': 'John Keller is everyone\'s favorite hit man.

Impeccably researched, filled with page-turning romance, passion, and scandal, Sex with the Queen explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers. She was the queen, living in an opulent palace, wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied, admired, and revered. She was also miserable, having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen, a royal ogre who was sadistic, foaming at the mouth, physically repulsive, mentally incompetent, or sexually impotent--and in some cases all of the above. How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone--swashbuckling generals, polished courtiers, and virile cardinals--many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered, and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen, who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs, which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover, anything could happen--from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen's lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair's implications in terms of power, money, and factional rivalry. At European courts, it was the politics--not the sex--that caused a royal woman's tragedy--or her ultimate triumph.… (more)", 'characters': ['Sophia Dorothea of Celle', 'Katherine Howard (Catherine Howard)', 'Diana, Princess of Wales', 'Marie Antoinette'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060850524': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1977', 'Members': '45,941', 'Reviews': '648', 'Popularity': '20', 'Average rating': '(3.95)', 'Mentions': '1236', 'summary': "Huxley's classic prophetic novel describes the socialized horrors of a futuristic utopia devoid of individual freedom.", 'characters': ['Bernard Marx', 'Lenina Crowne', 'John the Savage', 'Mustapha Mond', 'Helmholtz Watson', 'Henry Foster'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Waterstones Books of the Century (1997, No 15)', "BBC's Big Read (Best loved novel, 2003, No 87)", "The Modern Library's 100 Best Novels: The Board's List (5)", "The Modern Library's 100 Best Novels: The Reader's List (18)", 'Radcliffe Publishing Course Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century (16)', "The Observer's 100 Greatest Novels of All Time (53)", "Larry McCaffery's 20th Century Greatest Hits (44)", '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006/2008/2010/2012 Edition)', 'Guardian 1000 (Science Fiction & Fantasy)', 'ALA 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000 (52)', "The Telegraph's 110 Best Books: The Perfect Library (2008)", "Newsweek's Top 100 Books: The Meta-List (2009, No. 23)", 'ALA 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-1999 (54)', 'ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (1999.5|Fiction, 1999)', 'Arkham Sampler 1949 Survey by August Derleth (2)', 'Astounding/Analog Science Fiction and Fact 1952 All-Time Poll (22)', 'Astounding/Analog Science Fiction and Fact 1956 All-Time Poll (15)', "New York Public Library's Books of the Century (09|Utopias & Dystopias)", 'thisrecording.com 100 Greatest Science Fiction or Fantasy Novels of All Time (7)', 'Prometheus Award nominee (Hall of Fame Award for Best Classic Libertarian SF Novel, 1983)', "Cyril Connolly's 100 Key Books of the Modern Movement (1932)", '501 Must-Read Books (Science Fiction)', 'Classics of Science Fiction (20)', "The Essential Man's Library: 100 Must-Read Books", "Bloomsbury's 100 Must-Read Science Fiction Novels", "Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century (21)", 'Easton Press: The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written (10)', "Daily Telegraph's 100 Books of the Century, 1900-1999", 'AbeBooks: 50 Essential Science Fiction Books', 'From Zero to Well-Read in 100 Books (B)', "Christianity Today's Books of the Century", "The Observer's 100 Best Novels (56)", 'Геном русской души (37)', "NPR's Top 100 Science-Fiction, Fantasy Books (9)", '100 лучших книг по версии Дистопии (8)', 'ALA 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000-2009 (36)', '1000 лучших произведений мировой худ. литературы в русских переводах, рекомендованных для комплектования школьной библиотеки', '1001 böcker du måste läsa innan du dör', '1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)', 'Les 100 livres préférés des Français (26)', 'The New Lifetime Reading Plan With Going Further (117)', '100 Books That Shaped World History', 'Harenberg Buch der 1000 Bücher', 'Greatest Books algorithm (#72)']}, '9780060851989': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/970957', 'Members': '1,849', 'Reviews': '62', 'Popularity': '6,727', 'Average rating': '(3.61)', 'Mentions': '45', 'summary': "Lizzie Nichols has a problem, she can't keep her mouth shut.

Myth One: that Europe\'s leap forward occurred suddenly in the "Renaissance," following centuries of medieval stagnation. Not so, say the Gieses: Early modern technology and experimental science were direct outgrowths of the decisive innovations of medieval Europe, in the tools and techniques of agriculture, craft industry, metallurgy, building construction, navigation, and war. Myth Two: that Europe achieved its primacy through "Western" superiority. On the contrary, the authors report, many of Europe\'s most important inventions - the horse harness, the stirrup, the magnetic compass, cotton and silk cultivation and manufacture, papermaking, firearms, "Arabic" numerals - had their origins outside Europe, in China, India, and Islam. The Gieses show how Europe synthesized its own innovations - the three-field system, water power in industry, the full-rigged ship, the putting-out system - into a powerful new combination of technology, economics, and politics. From the expansion of medieval man\'s capabilities, the voyage of Columbus with all its fateful consequences is seen as an inevitable product, while even the genius of Leonardo da Vinci emerges from the context of earlier and lesser-known dreamers and tinkerers.

Disconcerted and enchanted, the reader follows the narrator of Slowness through a midsummer\'s night in which two tales of seduction, separated by more than two hundred years, interweave and oscillate between the sublime and the comic. In the eighteenth-century narrative, the marvelous Madame de T. summons a young nobleman to her chateau one evening and gives him an unforgettable lesson in the art of seduction and the pleasures of love.In the same chateau at the end of the twentieth century, a hapless young intellectual experiences a rather less successful night. Distracted by his desire to be the center of public attention at a convention of entomologists, Vincent loses the beautiful Julie - ready and willing though she is to share an evening of intimacy and sexual pleasure with him - and suffers the ridicule of his peers. A "morning-after" encounter between the two young men from different centuries brings the novel to a poignant close: Vincent has already obliterated the memory of his humiliation as he prepares to speed back to Paris on his motorcycle, while the young nobleman will lie back on the cushions of his carriage and relive the night before in the lingering pleasure of memory.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['70 лучших французских романов XX века по версии "Эксмо"']}, '9780060929596': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/5223', 'Members': '1,083', 'Reviews': '31', 'Popularity': '13,775', 'Average rating': '(3.88)', 'Mentions': '34', 'summary': "In 1967, after a twin baby boy suffered a botched circumcision, his family agreed to a radical treatment that would alter his gender.

In this unforgettable story, the secret fundamentals of golf, friendship, competition, and the inscrutable relationships between fathers and sons all combine to form an extraordinary tale. Bobby Jobe is a gifted golfer whose swing is much better than his attitude. Leading a major tournament in the final round, he gets distracted as usual -- and chokes, blowing his lead. Also as usual, he blames his caddy, Greyhound Mote, who stomps off the course: Greyhound is loyal, but Bobby's gone just one insult too far. Shortly thereafter, as he's leaving the golf club, Greyhound spots Bobby obsessively practicing the shot that earlier lost him the tournament. Overhead, the clouds of an approaching thunderstorm roil, and as Greyhound watches, lightning strikes -- and both of their lives are changed forever. Months later Greyhound has retreated to his small hometown, where he helps his mother run a shabby but proud nine-hole golf course. All he knows of Bobby since their last bitter farewell in a hospital room is that he has been permanently blinded. What he doesn't know is that an extraordinary woman has come into Bobby's life, determined to save him by convincing him he can still play competitive golf. And she believes that Greyhound is the person to help him do it.

Jay Parini paints an intimate picture of Faulkner\'s Mississippi world and shows how the artist transformed this raw material into Yoknapatawpha County, a place of pure imagination." "Between 1928 and 1942, during what Faulkner called his "one matchless time," a period of wild inspiration when characters and stories came to him mysteriously and in abundance, he published more than half a dozen masterpieces, including the novels The Sound and the Fury; As I Lay Dying; Sanctuary; Light in August; Absalom, Absalom!; The Wild Palms; Go Down, Moses; and The Hamlet. This is an astonishing achievement without equal in American literature." "Parini, who has taught Faulkner\'s work to students for nearly thirty years, brings to life this writer\'s complex fictional world in the context of his life, using the one to illuminate the other. He uses letters and memoirs unavailable to earlier biographers as well as interviews he had with Faulkner\'s daughter and several of his lovers.

Will human genetic engineering become commonplace? Will human cloning ever be safe? Are there many universes? How much will the climate change during the coming century? The Best American Science Writing 2002 gathers top writers and scientists covering the latest developments in the fastest-changing, farthest-reaching scientific fields, such as medicine, genetics, computer technology, evolutionary psychology, cutting-edge physics, and the environment. Among this year\'s selections: In "The Made-to-Order Savior," Lisa Belkin spotlights two desperate families seeking an unprecedented cure by a medically and ethically unprecedented means -- creating a genetically matched child. Margaret Talbot\'s "A Desire to Duplicate" reveals that the first human clone may very likely come from an entirely unexpected source, and sooner than we think. Michael Specter reports on the shock waves rippling through the field of neuroscience following the revolutionary discovery that adult brain cells might in fact regenerate ("Rethinking the Brain"). Christopher Dickey\'s "I Love My Glow Bunny" recounts with sly humor a peculiar episode in which genetic engineering and artistic culture collide. Natalie Angier draws an insightful contrast between suicide terrorists and rescue workers who risk their lives, and finds that sympathy and altruism have a definite place in the evolution of human nature, David Berlinski\'s "What Brings a World into Being?" ponders the idea of biology and physics as essentially digital technologies, exploring the mysteries encoded in the universe\'s smallest units, be they cells or quanta. Nicholas Wade shows how one of the most controversial books of the year, The Skeptical Environmentalist, by former Greenpeace member and self-described leftist Bjorn Lomborg, debunks some of the most cherished tenets of the environmental movement, suggesting that things are perhaps not as bad as we\'ve been led to believe. And as a counterpoint, Darcy Frey\'s profile of George Divoky reveals a dedicated researcher whose love of birds and mystery leads to some sobering discoveries about global warming and forcefully reminds us of the unsung heroes of science: those who put in long hours, fill in small details, and take great trouble. In the end, the unanswered questions are what sustain scientific inquiry, open new frontiers of knowledge, and lead to new technologies and medical treatments.

O'Donohue opens our eyes, hearts and minds to the wonder of our own relationship with beauty. Rather than 'covering' this theme, he uncovers it, exposing the infinity and mystery of its breadth. His words return us home to the dignity of silence, the profundity of stillness, the power of thought and perception, and the eternal grace and generosity of beauty's presence. In this masterful and revelatory work, O'Donohue encourages our greater intimacy with beauty, and celebrates it for what it really is- a homecoming of the human spirit.As he focuses on the classical, medieval and Celtic traditions, on art, music, literature, nature and language, O'Donohue reveals how beauty's invisible embrace invites us towards new heights of passion and creativity.DIVINE BEAUTY is an exquisite treasury of Forms of the Beautiful.

The father, Nelson O'Brien, is an enterprising Irish immigrant who travels to Cuba as a photographer during the Spanish-American War in 1898, and there he meets his future wife, the sensitive, aristocratic, poetic Mariela Montez. As they are enroute to America in 1902, their first daughter, Margarita, whose reminiscences inform much of this novel's narrative, is born at sea. The Montez O'Briens settle in a small Pennsylvania town, where Nelson practices his photography trade and runs the Jewel Box Movie Theater, and Mariela gives birth to thirteen more daughters and then, finally, a son. As Margarita looks back on her long and full life, the novel recounts the lives, loves, and tragedies of the Montez O'Briens and their always complex relations with one another. It also follows Emilio through his days in Greenwich Village, the army, and Hollywood, where, as Monty O'Brien, he stars in grade-B detective and Tarzan movies and pals around with screen idols like Errol Flynn. Never altogether at peace in the overwhelming feminine world of his family, he searches restlessly for an elusive true love. And after an unhappy early marriage, Margarita herself finds the deepest passion of her life in extreme old age. The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien is a raucous and heartfelt epic that spans both the continent and our century, a celebration of the moments of earthly happiness that give meaning to diverse yet deeply interrelated existences and of the constantly surprising, regenerating life force that keeps insisting on change and renewal.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780060976095': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/282762', 'Members': '494', 'Reviews': '6', 'Popularity': '37,086', 'Average rating': '(3.33)', 'Mentions': '13', 'summary': "One of Johnson's most celebrated novels, this horrifying yet touching vision of a nuclear-age America was hailed the New York Times as wildly ambitious.", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books (216|8 points)']}, '9780060976101': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/313031', 'Members': '209', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '98,687', 'Average rating': '(3.4)', 'Mentions': '10', 'summary': 'Set in Nicaragua in 1984, The Stars at Noon is a story of passion, fear, and betrayal told in the voice of an American woman whose mission in Central America is as shadowy as her surroundings.

As Homebody eloquently proves, no contemporary writer outshines Orson Scott Card in crafting unlikely heroes or in suffusing the everyday world with an otherworldly glow. Don Lark's cheery name belies his tragic past. When his alcoholic ex-wife killed their daughter in a car wreck, he retreated from the sort of settled, sociable lifestyle one takes for granted. Only the prospect of putting a roof over other people's heads seems to comfort Lark, and he goes from town to town, looking for dilapidated houses he can buy, restore and resell at a profit. In Greensboro, North Carolina, Lark finds his biggest challenge yet -- a huge, sturdy, gorgeous shell that's suffered almost a century of abuse at the hands of greedy landlords and transient tenants. As he sinks his teeth into this new project, Lark's new neighborhood starts to work its charms on him. He strikes up a romance with the wry real estate agent who sold him the house. His neighbors, two charming, chatty old ladies, ply him endlessly with delicious Southern cooking. Even Sylvie, the squatter Lark was once desperate to evict from the old house, is now growing on him. But when Lark unearths an old tunnel in the cellar, the house's enchantments start to turn ominous. Sylvie turns cantankerous, even dangerous. There's still a steady supply of food from next door, but it now comes laced with increasingly passionate pleas for Lark to vacate the house at once. In short, everybody seems to want to get rid of him. Whether this is for his own good or theirs, Lark digs in his heels for reasons even he's not sure of.

Now at Key West's Old Racquet Club, Chuck gets involved with the wrong married woman--the enticing Clare Carras, married to an enigmatic older man--and soon he is in way over his head. Enter Tommy Sculley, a retired New York homicide detective who has just joined the Key West force, and his young green partner, Daryl Haynes, who turns out to be smarter than he looks. Up to their necks in an investigation of a bizarre apparent homicide, the two detectives barely keep afloat in murky waters.

Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged-and ultimately triumphant-effort to overthrow the Soviet Union. Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan\'s efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the "Evil Empire." The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take--and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency. The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician-still in office today-in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan\'s 1984 reelection bid. Such new finds make The Crusader not just a work of extraordinary history, but a work of explosive revelation that will be debated as hotly in 2006 as Reagan\'s policies were in the 1980s.… (more)', 'characters': ['Robert F.

Its founder was Zeno of Cytium (not to be confused with Zeno of Elea, who discovered the famous paradoxes). He was born in Cyprus about 336 b.c., but all of his philosophical activity took place in Athens. For more than 500 years Stoicism was one of the most influential and fruitful philosophical movements in the Graeco-Roman world. The works of the earlier Stoics survive only in fragmentary quotations from other authors, but from the Renaissance until well into the nineteenth century, Stoic ethical thought was one of the most important ancient influences on European ethics, particularly because of the descriptions of it by Cicero, through surviving works by the Stoics Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and also Epictetus--and also because of the effect that it had had in antiquity, and continued to have into the nineteenth century, on Christian ethical views. Nowadays an undergraduate or graduate student learning about ancient philosophy in a university course may well hear only about Plato and Aristotle, along perhaps with the presocratics; but in the history of Western thought and education this situation is somewhat atypical, and in most periods a comparable student would have learned as much or more about Stoicism, as well as two other major ancient philosophical movements, Epicureanism and Scepticism. In spite of this lack of explicit acquaintance with Stoic philosophers and their works, however, most students will recognize in Epictetus various ideas that are familiar through their effects on other thinkers, notably Spinoza, in our intellectual tradition."… (more)', 'characters': ['Epictetus'], 'awards_and_honors': ['ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (1999.4|Non-fiction, 1999)']}, '9780062512796': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/67869', 'Members': '2,947', 'Reviews': '46', 'Popularity': '3,438', 'Average rating': '(3.4)', 'Mentions': '38', 'summary': "The Pilgrimage paved the way to Paulo Coehlo's international bestselling novel The Alchemist.

In March 1995, agents of a Japanese religious cult attacked the Tokyo subway system with sarin, a gas twenty six times as deadly as cyanide. Attempting to discover why, Murakami conducted hundreds of interviews with the people involved, from the survivors to the perpetrators to the relatives of those who died. Underground is their story in their own voices. Concerned with the fundamental issues that led to the attack as well as these personal accounts, Underground is a document of what happened in Tokyo as well as a warning of what could happen anywhere. This is an enthralling and unique work of nonfiction that is timely, vital, and as brilliantly executed as Murakami's novels. From Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Norwegian Wood, a work of literary journalism that is as fascinating as it is necessary, as provocative as it is profound. It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened; a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack. Attempting to discover why, Murakami conducted hundreds of interviews with the people involved, from a subway authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And, as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere. Hauntingly compelling and inescapably important, Underground is a powerful work of journalistic literature from one of the world's most perceptive writers. Concerned with the fundamental issues that led to the attack as well as these personal accounts, Underground is a document of what happened in Tokyo as well as a warning of what could happen anywhere.

In fact, Chickenhawk is still in print, a book that continues to serve as a testament for an entire generation.

"Although Mason\'s return was at first promising - after leaving active combat duty he began instructing future helicopter pilots - it quickly spiraled downward: into bouts of panic and increasingly heavy drinking, adulterous love affairs, jobs he could never keep. At the spiral\'s bottom lay an epic ocean voyage in a small boat. Destination: Colombia; cargo: marijuana; payoff: capture and a twenty-month prison term." "Mason recounts these events and his gradual healing from the wounds of Vietnam with caustic honesty, in powerful prose that conveys both the texture of despair and the hope that kept him going as he tried to maneuver through his own personal minefield. Above all, he writes with a bitter wisdom that makes this book an anthem for all those vets who lost a piece of themselves in Southeast Asia - and have spend a long, hard time trying to get it back."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Or it begins with a sudden, violent death. Or it begins as Peter Aaron sits down to tell the story of his best friend, Benjamin Sachs - to take us, through a life, to the road in rural Wisconsin where Sachs has accidentally blown himself up. Aaron\'s sole aim is to tell the truth and preserve it, before those who are investigating the case invent a story of their own. Aaron\'s clues are the small mysteries of any lifetime. Sachs had a marriage Aaron envied, an intelligence he admired, a circle of friends he shared. And then suddenly, after a near-fatal fall that might or might not have been intentional, Sachs disappears. For a while, Aaron\'s only link to him is through Maria Turner, an artist, and the one witness to Sachs\'s balcony plunge. Periodically, Sachs reappears, talks manically, and vanishes again - in pursuit of mercy or salvation, in thrall to an idea. Since the first book in his brilliant and acclaimed "New York Trilogy," Paul Auster\'s "rare combination of talent, scope, and audacity" (The New Republic) has given us worlds in which chance and destiny collide, in which solitary protagonists take us on mysterious, soul-wrenching journeys unparalleled in contemporary fiction. His seventh novel is about friendship and betrayal, sexual desire and estrangement, and the unpredictable intrusions of violence in the everyday. Rooted in American mythology and archetype, Leviathan is both timeless and resolutely about this moment.

The result is one of the funniest and most disturbing stories ever told about the corruption of the American dream.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['National Book Award (Fiction, 1976)', "Larry McCaffery's 20th Century Greatest Hits (17)", '61 Essential Postmodern Reads (30)', 'The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books (149|10 points)', 'The New Lifetime Reading Plan With Going Further (161.2)']}, '9780140188264': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/424295', 'Members': '220', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '93,475', 'Average rating': '(3.75)', 'Mentions': '39', 'summary': 'In the 1970s Shiva Naipaul travelled to Africa, visiting Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia for several months.

With exclusive and unprecedented access to all of Nin\'s unpublished archives, including more than 250,000 handwritten diary pages, Bair paints a startlingly different portrait of Nin, hitherto best known for her sexual peccadilloes and especially her affair with Henry Miller. Bair reveals Nin\'s lifelong struggle to become a respected writer, to position herself at the right hand of the intellectual elite, and to construct a way of life so complicated that it verged at times on incomprehensibility, even to herself." ""To live life as a dream" was Nin\'s motto, and she did so. She was a bigamist for more than thirty years, creating a "Lie Box" to help her keep her stories straight. And always she kept her diary, which eventually became one of the most astonishing renderings of a contemporary woman\'s life, noted as much for what she left out as for what she included. Bair\'s biography fills in the blanks and shows how Nin reflected the major themes that have come to characterize the latter half of the twentieth century: the quest for the self, the uses of psychoanalysis, and the determination of women to control their own sexuality."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

He chronicles the fifteenth-century politics of the Hanseatic League and the cod wars of the sixteenth and twentieth centuries. He embellishes his story with gastronomic detail, blending in recipes and lore from the Middle Ages to the present. And he brings to life the cod itself: its personality, habits, extended family, and ultimately the tragedy of how the most profitable fish in history is today faced with extinction. From fishing ports in New England and Newfoundland to coastal skiffs, schooners, and factory ships across the Atlantic; from Iceland and Scandinavia to the coasts of England, Brazil, and West Africa, Mark Kurlansky tells a story that brings world history and human passions into captivating focus.

Archie-working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt-is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin.  When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie\'s car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.  Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teeth is the story of two North London families-one headed by Archie, the other by Archie\'s best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal.  Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair.  Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for "no problem").  Samad-devoutly Muslim, hopelessly "foreign"-weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union.  They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd.  The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire\'s worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.  Zadie Smith\'s dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute.

And everywhere are the anomalies that burst the bubble of optimism: a vastly expensive luxury hotel sitting empty in an unknown town six hours from an international airport; museums crammed with fake exhibits.

Here is the month-by month account of the charms and frustrations that Peter Mayle and his wife -- and their two large dogs -- experience their first year in the remote country of the Luberon restoring a two-centuries-old stone farmhouse that they bought on sight. From coping in January with the first mistral, which comes howling down from the Rhone Valley and wreaks havoc with the pipes, to dealing as the months go by with the disarming promises and procrastination of the local masons and plumbers, Peter Mayle delights us with his strategies for survival. He relishes the growing camaraderie with his country neighbors -- despite the rich, soupy, often impenetrable patois that threatens to separate them. He makes friends with boar hunters and truffle hunters, a man who eats foxes, and another who bites dentists; he discovers the secrets of handicapping racing goats and of disarming vipers. And he comes to dread the onslaught of tourists who disrupt his tranquillity. In this often hilarious, seductive book Peter Mayle manages to transport us info all the earthy pleasures of Provencal life and lets us live vicariously in a tempo governed by seasons, not by days.

For Nietzsche, Greek tragedy is the expression of a culture which has achieved a delicate but powerful balance between Dionysian insight into the chaos and suffering whichunderlies all existence and the discipline and clarity of rational Apollonian form.

R. R. Tolkien\'s The Lord of the Rings No poem in German literature is so well known and studied in Germany and Europe as the 800-year-old Das Nibelungenlied. In the English-speaking world, however, the poem has remained little known, languishing without an adequate translation. This wonderful new translation by eminent translator Burton Raffel brings the epic poem to life in English for the first time, rendering it in verse that does full justice to the original High Middle German. His translation underscores the formal aspects of the poem and preserves its haunting beauty. Often called the German lliad, Das Nibelungenlied is a heroic epic both national in character and sweeping in scope. The poem moves inexorably from romance through tragedy to holocaust. It portrays the existential struggles and downfall of an entire people, the Burgundians, in a military conflict with the Huns and their king. In his foreword to the book, Michael Dirda observes that\xa0the story "could be easily updated to describe the downfall of a Mafia crime family, something like The Godfather, with swords." The tremendous appeal of Das Nibelungenlied throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is reflected in such works as Richard Wagner\'s opera tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen, Fritz Lang\'s two-part film Die Nibelungen, and, more recently, J.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated by David Barrett with revisions, an introduction and notes by Shomit Dutta.The master of ancient Greek comic drama, Aristophanes combined slapstick, humour and cheerful vulgarity with acute political observations. In The Frogs, written during the Peloponnesian War, Dionysus descends to the Underworld to bring back a poet who can help Athens in its darkest hour, and stages a great debate to help him decide between the traditional wisdom of Aeschylus and the brilliant modernity of Euripides. The clash of generations and values is also the object of Aristophanes' satire in Wasps, in which an old-fashioned father and his loose-living son come to blows and end up in court. And in Women at the Thesmophoria, the famous Greek tragedian Euripides, accused of misogyny, persuades a relative to infiltrate an all-women festival to find out whether revenge is being plotted against him.Shomit Dutta's introduction discusses Aristophanes' life, the cultural context of his work and conventions of Greek comedy. This updated version of David Barrett's translation also includes extensive notes and a preface for each play.Aristophanes (c.445-386 BC) was probably born in Athens. Little is known about his life, but there is a portrait of him in Plato'sSymposium. He was twice threatened with prosecution for his outspoken attacks on the prominent politician Cleon, but in 405 he was publicly honoured and crowned for promoting Athenian civic unity in The Frogs. Aristophanes had his first comedy produced when he was about twenty-one, and wrote forty plays in all. The eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes are published in the Penguin Classics series as The Birds and Other Plays, Lysistrata and Other Plays, The Wasps and Other Plays and The Frogs and Other Plays.If you enjoyed The Frogs and Other Plays,you might like Aristophanes' Lysistrata and Other Plays, also available in Penguin Classics.… (more)", 'characters': ['Euripides', 'Aeschylus'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780140441734': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/9491', 'Members': '619', 'Reviews': '2', 'Popularity': '28,182', 'Average rating': '(3.46)', 'Conversations / Mentions': '1 / 35', 'summary': "Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot--of the triumvirate that dominated French letters in the eighteenth century, Diderot was unmatched in the sheer breadth and depth of his interests and ideas.

Philippe and Joseph Bridau are two extremely different brothers. The elder, Philippe, is a superficially heroic soldier and adored by their mother Agathe. He is nonetheless a bitter figure, secretly gambling away her savings after a brief but glorious career as Napoleon's aide-de-camp at the battle of Montereau. His younger brother Joseph, meanwhile, is fundamentally virtuous - but their mother is blinded to his kindness by her disapproval of his life as an artist. Foolish and prejudiced, Agathe lives on unaware that she is being cynically manipulated by her own favourite child - but will she ever discover which of her sons is truly the black sheep of the family? A dazzling depiction of the power of money and the cruelty of life in nineteenth-century France, The Black Sheep compellingly explores is a compelling exploration of the nature of deceit.

This Penguin Classics edition of The Complete Essays is translated from the French and edited with an introduction and notes by M.A. Screech. In 1572 Montaigne retired to his estates in order to devote himself to leisure, reading and reflection. There he wrote his constantly expanding 'assays', inspired by the ideas he found in books contained in his library and from his own experience. He discusses subjects as diverse as war-horses and cannibals, poetry and politics, sex and religion, love and friendship, ecstasy and experience. But, above all, Montaigne studied himself as a way of drawing out his own inner nature and that of men and women in general. The Essays are among the most idiosyncratic and personal works in all literature and provide an engaging insight into a wise Renaissance mind, continuing to give pleasure and enlightenment to modern readers. With its extensive introduction and notes, M.A. Screech's edition of Montaigne is widely regarded as the most distinguished of recent times. Michel de Montaigne (1533-1586) studied law and spent a number of years working as a counsellor before devoting his life to reading, writing and reflection.

The result is a major contribution to the art of translation. Those less familiar with Consolation may remember it was written under a death sentence. Boethius (c. 480-524), an Imperial official under Theodoric, Ostrogoth ruler of Rome, found himself, in a time of political paranoia, denounced, arrested, and then executed two years later without a trial. Composed while its author was imprisoned, cut off from family and friends, it remains one of Western literature's most eloquent meditations on the transitory nature of earthly belongings, and the superiority of things of the mind.

The story begins with a historical event, the 1672 lynching of the Dutch Grand Pensionary (roughly equivalent to a modern Prime Minister) Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, by a wild mob of their own countrymen, considered by many as one of the most painful episodes in Dutch history, described by Dumas with a dramatic intensity.The main plot line, involving fictional characters, takes place in the following eighteen months; only gradually does the reader understand its connection with the killing of the de Witt brothers.The city of Haarlem, Netherlands, has set a prize of 100,000 guilders to the person who can grow a black tulip, sparking competition between the country's best gardeners to win the money, honour and fame. Only the city's oldest citizens remember the Tulip Mania thirty years prior, and the citizens throw themselves into the competition. The young and bourgeois Cornelius van Baerle has almost succeeded but is suddenly thrown into the Loevestein prison. . .Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870), also known as Alexandre Dumas, père, was a French writer, best known for his historical novels of high adventure. Translated into nearly 100 languages, these have made him one of the most widely read French authors in the world. Many of his novels, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Ten Years Later were originally published as serials.

Happiness is made up of activities in which we use the best human capacities, both ones that contribute to our flourishing asmembers of a community, and ones that allow us to engage in god-like contemplation.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Greek by David Barrett and Alan H. Sommerstein.The plays in this volume all contain Aristophanes' trademark bawdy comedy and dazzling verbal agility. In The Birds, two cunning Athenians persuade the birds to build the utopian city of 'Much Cuckoo in the Clouds' in the sky, blockading the Olympian gods and installing themselves as new deities. The Knightsis a venomous satire on Cleon, a prominent Athenian demagogue, who vies with a humble sausage-seller for the approval of the people; while The Assembly-Women deals with the battle of the sexes as the women of Athens infiltrate the all-male Assembly in disguise.

For while the naïve Gascon soldier cares little for the politics behind the battles, he is torn apart by a deep passion for two powerful women on opposing sides of the war: Nanon de Lartigues, a keen supporter of the Queen Regent Anne of Austria, and the Victomtesse de Cambes, who supports the rebellious forces of the Princess de Condé. Set around Bordeaux during the first turbulent years of the reign of Louis XIV, The Women's War sees two women taking central stage in a battle for all France. Humorous, dramatic and romantic, it offers a compelling exploration of political intrigue, the power of redemption, the force of love and the futility of war.

Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene uses these questions to guide us toward modern science\'s new and deeper understanding of the universe. From Newton\'s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein\'s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics\' entangled arena where vastly distant objects can bridge their spatial separation to instantaneously coordinate their behavior or even undergo teleportation, Greene reveals our world to be very different from what common experience leads us to believe. Focusing on the enigma of time, Greene establishes that nothing in the laws of physics insists that it run in any particular direction and that "time\'s arrow" is a relic of the universe\'s condition at the moment of the big bang. And in explaining the big bang itself, Greene shows how recent cutting-edge developments in superstring and M-theory may reconcile the behavior of everything from the smallest particle to the largest black hole. This startling vision culminates in a vibrant eleven-dimensional "multiverse," pulsating with ever-changing textures, where space and time themselves may dissolve into subtler, more fundamental entities. Sparked by the trademark wit, humor, and brilliant use of analogy that have made The Elegant Universe a modern classic, Brian Greene takes us all, regardless of ourscientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.

Julie Orringer\'s characters-all of them submerged by loss, whether of parents or lovers or a viable relationship to the world in general-struggle mightily against the wildly engulfing forces that threaten to overtake us all. All of them learn, gloriously if at great cost, how to breathe underwater. In "Pilgrims," a band of motherless children torment each other on Thanksgiving day. In "The Isabel Fish," the sole survivor of a drowning accident takes up scuba diving. In "When She Is Old and I Am Famous," a young woman confronts the inscrutable power of her cousin\'s beauty ("Aida. That is her terrible name. Ai-ee-duh: two cries of pain and one of stupidity"). In "The Smoothest Way Is Full of Stones," the failure of religious and moral codes-to protect, to comfort, to offer solace-is seen through the eyes of a group of Orthodox Jewish adolescents discovering the irresistible power of their burgeoning sexuality. In story after story, Orringer captures moments when the dark contours of the adult world come sharply into focus: Here are young people abandoned to their own devices, thrust too soon into predicaments of insoluble difficulty, and left to fend for themselves against the wide variety of human trouble. Buoyed by the exquisite tenderness of remembered love, they learn to take up residence in this strange new territory, if not to transcend it, and to fashion from their grief new selves, new lives. Orringer\'s debut collection blazes with emotion, with human appetite, with fortitude, with despair; these nine uncommonly wise and assured storiesintroduce an astonishing new talent.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the Year (2003)', 'William Saroyan International Prize for Writing Finalist (Fiction, 2005)']}, '9780141016702': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/155416', 'Members': '2,105', 'Reviews': '26', 'Popularity': '5,601', 'Average rating': '(3.76)', 'Mentions': '52', 'summary': "Prince Hal parts from his past to fulfill his royal destiny in this essential conclusion to Henry IV, Part 1.

It covers a period of intense social change from the 1880s to the 1930s, making direct reference to suffrage, Irish Home Rule, the First World War and anti-semitism. The novel\'s composition history is unusually complex; the text changed radically from its inception in 1931 to its publication in 1937. This edition provides readers with a fully collated and annotated text. It includes a substantial introduction that charts the composition process, a detailed chronology and full annotation of all historical, cultural and topographical references. All variants from extant galley and page proofs, as well as editions of the novel produced in Woolf\'s lifetime, are included, and reveal the significant and crucial changes Woolf made even in the months before publication"--\n"How should we read the writings of Virginia Woolf? This is not so much a question of interpretation as of practice. How are we to read this writer for whom reading is an activity that requires almost the same talents and energies as the activity of writing itself ? For Woolf responds to the question, \'How should one read a book?\', as a person of immense, virtuosic skill and experience in both activities. She understands the reader to be the \'fellow-worker and accomplice\' (E5 573) of the writer. The \'quickest way to understand [. . .] what a novelist is doing is not to read\', she suggests, \'but to write; to make your own experiment with the dangers and difficulties of words\' (E5 574); and \'the time to read poetry\', she recognises, is \'when we are almost able to write it\' (E5 577). Not only has Woolf left a richly rewarding oeuvre, but she has also left ample documentation of her meticulous processes of composition and of her detailed involvement in the production and publishing of many of her works, all of which her active and conscientious reader will wish to negotiate. If we are going to read Woolf creatively and critically, ifwe are to follow our own instincts, use our own reason and come to our own conclusions, as she herself advises, we need to read her works in a form that provides us with the fullest means possible to exercise these powers, one that gives us as much unmediated access as possible to the record of these processes. This Cambridge edition of Woolf\'s writings consequently aims to provide readers and scholars, Woolf\'s fellow-workers and accomplices, with an extensively researched, fully explicated and collated text"--… (more)', 'characters': ['Colonel Abel Pargiter', 'Mira', 'Lulu', 'Eleanor Pargiter'], 'awards_and_honors': ['1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006 Edition)', 'Publishers Weekly Bestseller (Fiction, 1937)', "Western World's Greatest Books - Project Gutenberg", 'Audie Award Finalist (Classics, 2007)']}, '9780141185361': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/3570', 'Members': '2,300', 'Reviews': '41', 'Popularity': '4,929', 'Average rating': '(3.59)', 'Mentions': '103', 'summary': 'Through the eyes of Miss Toklas, Gertrude Stein reviews both of their lives before their meeting and during their years of companionship.', 'characters': ['Alice B.

Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero\'s foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collins\'s narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins\'s other great mystery, The Moonstone, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of The Woman in White."… (more)', 'characters': ['Count Fosco', 'Marian Halcombe', 'Laura Fairlie Glyde', 'Percival Glyde', 'Anne Catherick', 'Walter Hartright', 'Frederick Fairlie', 'Countess Fosco', 'Mrs Clements', 'Vincent Gilmore', 'Eliza Michelson', 'Mrs Catherick', 'Pesca', 'Mr. Kyrle'], 'awards_and_honors': ["BBC's Big Read (Best loved novel, 2003, No 77)", "The Observer's 100 Greatest Novels of All Time (23)", 'Guardian 1000 (Crime)', '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006/2008/2010/2012 Edition)', "The Telegraph's 110 Best Books: The Perfect Library (2008)", "Julian Symons' 100 Best Crime Stories (1860)", "Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time - UK Crime Writers' Association (28)", 'The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time Mystery Writers of America (32)', "Daniel S.

Based on the experiences of her father, who was a young boy in the Philippines during World War II, Holthe's story begins during the final week of the ferocious Japanese-American battle for possession of the Philippines. Here, we listen to three distinct narrators who reveal the struggle to survive in a small community outside Manila, where the streets are littered with dead bodies and the threat of capture by Japanese soldiers is around every corner. First, thirteen-year-old Alejandro Karangalan and his younger brother leave the safety of the basement where his family and others are hiding to go look for food for their family and medicine for their ailing father. They are caught by Japanese militants and wrongly accused of murder. Meanwhile, Alejandro's older sister, Isabelle, has been missing for days. As the family fears for her safety, Isabelle is met with the choice of avoiding a Japanese patrol or helping an injured guerrilla commander, whom she believes is responsible for the brutal Japanese counterattacks on their people. Her decisions lead her through a maelstrom of events that leave her stripped of her soul. At the same time, Domingo Matapang, the passionate guerilla commander, is torn between his pivotal role of helping his troops defeat the enemy, or protecting the lives of his wife and child. Will he follow the path of a warrior and a future with his soulmate, Chita, a feisty double agent, or the path of a provider for his wife Lorna and his beloved sons? As the war rages outside, five tales of hope and superstition unfold in the cellar. The stories, which are fueled by the myths and superstitions that were told with reverence in Holthe's Filipino household, help the civilians endure the atrocities and find hope in the midst of chaos.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['School Library Journal Best Book of the Year (2002)']}, '9780142003268': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/38539', 'Members': '1,957', 'Reviews': '36', 'Popularity': '6,218', 'Average rating': '(3.09)', 'Mentions': '66', 'summary': "The Spy Who Loved Meis the tenth of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, where the British agent, in America, rescues a damsel in distress...

He set this legend in a small, minutely realized parallel universe that he called Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. No single volume better conveys the scope of Faulkner\'s vision than The Portable Faulkner. The book includes self-contained episodes from the novels The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, and Sanctuary; the stories\xa0"The Bear," "Spotted Horses," "A Rose for Emily," and "Old Man," among others; a map of Yoknapatawpha County and a chronology of the Compson family created by Faulkner especially for this edition; and the complete text of Faulkner\'s 1950 address upon receiving the Nobel Prize in literature.

According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is "a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all." Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow\'s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today\'s America is the result of Hamilton\'s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. "To repudiate his legacy," Chernow writes, "is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world." Chernow here recounts Hamilton\'s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington\'s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States. Historians have long told the story of America\'s birth as the triumph of Jefferson\'s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we\'ve encountered before-from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton\'s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804. Chernow\'s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America\'s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.… (more)', 'characters': ['Alexander Hamilton', 'Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton', 'James Madison', 'Aaron Burr', 'John Jay', 'George Washington', 'Thomas Jefferson', 'Abigail Adams', 'Charles Adams', 'Henry Adams', 'John Adams', 'John Quincy Adams', 'Samuel Adams', 'Joseph Addison', 'William Alexander, Lord Stirling', 'Theodosia Burr', 'Fisher Ames', 'John André', 'Richard Arkwright', 'Benedict Arnold', 'Margaret Shippen Arnold', 'Benjamin Franklin Bache', 'Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626', 'Bernard Bailyn', 'Francis Barber', 'John Barbot', 'James A.

Barcelona, 1945-just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother's face. To console his only child, Daniel's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel's father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax's work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly. As with all astounding novels, The Shadow of the Wind sends the mind groping for comparisons- The Crimson Petal and the White? The novels of Arturo Peacute-Reverte? Of Victor Hugo? Love in the Time of Cholera ?-but in the end, as with all astounding novels, no comparison can suffice. As one leading Spanish reviewer wrote, ldquo.

He has been described by the Baltimore Sun as the "master of the non-fiction narrative." This powerful and inspiring new book shows how one person can make a difference, as Kidder tells the true story of a gifted man who is in love with the world and has set out to do all he can to cure it. At the center of Mountains Beyond Mountains stands Paul Farmer. Doctor, Harvard professor, renowned infectious-disease specialist, anthropologist, the recipient of a MacArthur "genius" grant, world-class Robin Hood, Farmer was brought up in a bus and on a boat, and in medical school found his life\'s calling: to diagnose and cure infectious diseases and to bring the lifesaving tools of modern medicine to those who need them most. This magnificent book shows how radical change can be fostered in situations that seem insurmountable, and it also shows how a meaningful life can be created, as Farmer--brilliant, charismatic, charming, both a leader in international health and a doctor who finds time to make house calls in Boston and the mountains of Haiti--blasts through convention to get results. Mountains Beyond Mountains takes us from Harvard to Haiti, Peru, Cuba, and Russia as Farmer changes minds and practices through his dedication to the philosophy that "the only real nation is humanity" - a philosophy that is embodied in the small public charity he founded, Partners In Health. He enlists the help of the Gates Foundation, George Soros, the U.N.\'s World Health Organization, and others in his quest to cure the world. At the heart of this book is the example of a life based on hope, and on an understanding of the truth of the Haitian proverb "Beyond mountains there are mountains": as you solve one problem, another problem presents itself, and so you go on and try to solve that one too. "Mountains Beyond Mountains unfolds with the force of a gathering revelation," says Annie Dillard, and Jonathan Harr says, "[Farmer] wants to change the world. Certainly this luminous and powerful book will change the way you see it."

This memoir, first published in 1990 and reissued with a new preface by the author, recounts Farrell\'s transformation from a young girl in Ohio dreaming of greatness to the realization of that dream on stages all over the world.\xa0 Central to this transformation was her relationship with George Balanchine, who invited her to join the New York City Ballet in the fall of 1961 and was in turn inspired by her unique combination of musical, physical, and dramatic gifts. He created masterpieces for her in which the limits of ballet technique were expanded to a degree not seen before.\xa0 By the time she retired from the stage in 1989, Farrell had achieved a career that is without precedent in the history of ballet. One third of her repertory of more than 100 ballets were composed expressly for her by such notable choreographers as Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Maurice Bejart.\xa0 Farrell recalls professional and personal attachments and their attendant controversies with a down-to-earth frankness and common sense that complements the glories and mysteries of her artistic achievement.\xa0\xa0 Suzanne Farrell has staged Balanchine\'s ballets in New York, Boston, Seattle, and Miami and for the Vienna Opera Ballet, the Kirov, and the Bolshoi.

Bentley\'s association with the New York City Ballet began when she was accepted by the affiliated School of American Ballet at the age of eleven.\xa0 Seven years later, she became a member of the company. In the fall of 1980, as the winter season opened, she found herself facing an emotional crisis: her dancing was not going well.\xa0 At 22 she felt that her life had lost direction. To try to make something of her experience, on paper if not on stage, she began to keep a journal, describing her day-to-day activities and looking back on her past. The result is perhaps the closest that most of us will ever come to knowing what it feels like to be a dancer, on stage and off.\xa0 It also offers memorable glimpses of some notable members of the City ballet, with, at the center, the man whose vision they all served--George Balanchine. Toni Bentley was born in Perth, Australia, and after moving to Bristol, England, took her first ballet lesson at the age of four. At the age of 18 she became a member of George Balanchine\'s New York City Ballet, where she performed for ten years. Since retiring from dancing, she has written Holding On to the Air with Suzanne Farrell (Farrell\'s autobiography), Costumes by Karinska, and Sisters of Salome, as well as articles for periodicals ranging from the New York Times, New York Newsday, and the Los Angeles Times, to Rolling Stone, Smithsonian, Mirabella, and Ballet Review.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780813191553': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/654059', 'Members': '95', 'Reviews': '2', 'Popularity': '221,605', 'Average rating': '(3.41)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'From the Academy Award-winning Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Academy Award-nominated Adaptation (2002) to the cult classic Being John Malkovich (1999), screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is widely admired for his innovative, philosophically resonant films.

[and] demonstrated the power of the common people in a manner which no subsequent government has ever allowed itself to forget." We can learn a great deal from studying the French Revolution itself, but we can also learn from studying the ways in which scholars have interpreted the French Revolution, and from the ways their views have changed. For over a century following the Revolution, commentators and scholars spoke of it in glowing terms. But in the past three decades, revisionist historians have become skeptical. Eric Hobsbawm reiterates the centrality of the Revolution for history on a global basis. He argues that those who wrote about the Revolution in the nineteenth century were convinced it had changed their lives dramatically, improving the economy and the lot of peasants. They saw the Revolution as a prototype of of the bourgeois revolution, enabling the middle class to gain power from the ruling class of aristocrats. Many believed proletarian revolutions would inevitably follow. In the years between 1917 and the 1960s, Marxists continued to use the French Revolution as a point of reference, paying increasing attention to the social and economic factors in the Revolution, not only to the political factors. In the 1970s and 1980s, many historians began to argue that the Revolution achieved modest results at disproportionate costs. Hobsbawm argues that this massive historiographical reaction against the centrality of the Revolution reflects the personal politics of those contemporary historians for whom Marxism and communism are now out of favor. They are, he maintains, wrong.

The novel unconventionally presents a "little woman," a true-hearted abolitionist spinster, and a fallen Cuban beauty, their lives intersecting in Alcott\'s first major depiction of the "woman problem." Sylvia Yule, the heroine of Moods, is a passionate tomboy who yearns for adventure.\xa0 The novel opens as she embarks on a river camping trip with her brother and his two friends, both of whom fall in love with her. These rival suitors, close friends, are modeled on Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Daniel Thoreau. Aroused, but still "moody" and inexperienced, Sylvia marries the wrong man. In the rest of the novel, Alcott attempts to resolve the dilemma she has created and leave her readers asking whether, in fact, there is a place for a woman such as Sylvia in a man\'s world.\xa0\xa0 In 1882, eighteen years after the original publication, Alcott revised and republished the novel. Her own literary success and the changes she helped forge in women\'s lives now allowed her heroine to meet, as Alcott said, "a wiser if less romantic fate than in the former edition."

Along with an introduction by leading Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, the volume includes a biographical introduction, informative introductions to each section, and a glossary of key terms to help readers better grasp the legacy of this important figure.

Lowe discusses the contradictions whereby Asians have been included in the workplaces and markets of the U.S. nation-state, yet, through exclusion laws and bars from citizenship, have been distanced from the terrain of national culture. Lowe argues that a national memory haunts the conception of Asian American, persisting beyond the repeal of individual laws and sustained by U.S. wars in Asia, in which the Asian is seen as the perpetual immigrant, as the "foreigner-within." In Immigrant Acts, she argues that rather than attesting to the absorption of cultural difference into the universality of the national political sphere, the Asian immigrant--at odds with the cultural, racial, and linguistic forms of the nation--displaces the temporality of assimilation. Distance from the American national culture constitutes Asian American culture as an alternative site that produces cultural forms materially and aesthetically in contradiction with the institutions of citizenship and national identity. Rather than a sign of a "failed" integration of Asians into the American cultural sphere, this critique preserves and opens up different possibilities for political practice and coalition across racial and national borders. In this uniquely interdisciplinary study, Lowe examines the historical, political, cultural, and aesthetic meanings of immigration in relation to Asian Americans. Extending the range of Asian American critique, Immigrant Acts will interest readers concerned with race and ethnicity in the United States, American cultures, immigration, and transnationalism.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780822331131': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/812603', 'Members': '33', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '579,668', 'Average rating': '(3)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'Moving the critical debate about photography away from its current Euro-American center of gravity, Photography\'s Other Histories breaks with the notion that photographic history is best seen as the explosion of a Western technology advanced by the work of singular individuals. This collection presents a radically different account, describing photography as a globally disseminated and locally appropriated medium. Essays firmly grounded in photographic practice--in the actual making of pictures--suggest the extraordinary diversity of nonwestern photography. Richly illustrated with over 100 images, Photography\'s Other Histories explores from a variety of regional, cultural, and historical perspectives the role of photography in raising historical consciousness. It includes two first-person pieces by indigenous Australians and one by a Seminole/Muskogee/Dine\' artist. Some of the essays analyze representations of colonial subjects--from the limited ways Westerners have depicted Navajos to Japanese photos recording the occupation of Manchuria to the changing "contract" between Aboriginal subjects and photographers. Other essays highlight the visionary quality of much popular photography. Case studies centered in early-twentieth-century Peru and contemporary India, Kenya, and Nigeria chronicle the diverse practices that have flourished in postcolonial societies. Photography\'s Other Histories recasts popular photography around the world, as not simply reproducing culture but creating it.  Contributors.

The result is a lively narrative that is also an original inquiry into the driving forces behind sixteenth-century Spanish colonialism. In six overlapping topical narratives Lane brings to life a place wracked by civil disturbances, shipwrecks, indigenous uprisings, pirate attacks, maroon intransigence, urban decadence, failed missionary endeavors, sharp economic reorientations, and wily and unpredictable subaltern adaptation and resistance. Drawing from a wealth of recent research on the colonial north Andes and on more than seven years of study in the archives of Ecuador, Colombia, and Spain, Lane presents rich discoveries of interest to economic historians, including a previously unknown gold boom; however, his primary interest is people. He explores the ways both individuals and groups--shipwreck victims, slaves, laborers, merchants, traders--faced obstacles and seized (or missed) opportunities, showing readers not only the basic facts and major themes of colonial life but also the influence and outcome of individual hopes and fears among people from a multitude of races and ethnicities.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780826406736': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/187080', 'Members': '230', 'Reviews': '2', 'Popularity': '89,010', 'Average rating': '(3.78)', 'Mentions': '2', 'summary': 'This classic work by psychologist and social philosopher Eric Fromm builds upon his previous popular book To Have or to Be?

We live in terror of disease, abuse, stranger danger, environmental devastation and terrorist onslaught. We are bombarded with reports of new concerns for our safety and that of our children, and urged to take greater precautions and seek more protection. But compared to the past, or to the developing world, people in contemporary Western societies have much less familiarity with pain, suffering, debilitating disease and death. We actually enjoy an unprecedented level of personal safety. ¿ When confronted with events like the destruction of the World Trade Centre, fear for the future is inevitable. But what happened on September 11th 2001 was in many ways an old fashioned act of terror, representing the destructive side of the human passions. Frank Furedi argues that the greater danger in our culture is the tendency to fear achievements representing a more constructive side of humanity.

The five years he spent in the Algerian bagnios or prison-houses (1575-1580) made an indelible impression on his works. From the first plays and narratives written after his release to his posthumous novel, the story of Cervantes's traumatic experience continuously speaks through his writings. Cervantes in Algiers offers a comprehensive view of his life as a slave and, particularly, of the lingering effects this traumatic experience had on his literary production. No work has documented in such vivid and illuminating detail the socio-political world of sixteenth-century Algiers, Cervantes's life in the prison-house, his four escape attempts, and the conditions of his final ransom. Garces's portrait of a sophisticated multi-ethnic culture in Algiers, moreover, is likely to open up new discussions about early modern encounters between Christians and Muslims. By bringing together evidence from many different sources, historical and literary, Garces reconstructs the relations between Christians, Muslims, and renegades in a number of Cervantes's writings. The idea that survivors of captivity need to repeat their story in order to survive (an insight invoked from Coleridge to Primo Levi to Dori Laub) explains not only Cervantes's storytelling but also the book that theorizes it so compellingly.

Brokenness and pain seem to have increased as well, with news of civil war, poverty, broken families and sex-trafficking touching us daily. The urgent need for prayer is clear, but busyness still keeps many of us from finding time to pray.

The text tells us that, in that lonely hour, a group of women were watching the crucifixion "from a distance." In a sense, they are given a stance toward the cross that we can share.In this exploration of Mark\'s Gospel, Peter G.

After all, the quincentennial of the "discovery of America" finds the Latin American republics in a state of deep crisis, with inflation, unemployment, and excessive foreign debt threatening their still precarious economic and political institutions. But Fuentes finds much consolation in an amazingly rich cultural heritage, one that has been created with "the greatest joy, the greatest gravity, and the greatest risk" and that lives in art, in literature, and above all in the vital societies of Central and South America." "From the mysterious cave drawings at Altamira to the explosive graffiti on the walls of East Los Angeles, images of Spain and the Americas speak to us of the great variety of Spanish culture. Carlos Fuentes knows this culture intimately. Combining a sophisticated perspective on world events and a novelist\'s eye for irony and metaphor, he weaves a historical narrative of dazzling color and vibrancy. Sweeping across centuries of tumultuous history, Fuentes gives new life to monarchs and conquistadors, to Indian cultures and revolutions, and finally to modern-day Spain, Latin America, and the Hispanic United States. History and its players come alive on every page, in the stories of the famous and the little-known, the heroes and tyrants, martyrs and saints, virgins and kings." "Using the illuminating metaphor of mirrors, inspired by mirrors found in ancient burial caches in the Americas, Fuentes challenges us to think in new ways about how a national character is formed, how a stereotype evolves, and what continuities are discovered when a human community truly understands its roots. Illustrated with more than 160 stunning drawings, paintings, and photographs, The Buried Mirror celebrates a culture of enormous wealth and diversity, as Carlos Fuentes fulfills the poet Pablo Neruda\'s resounding cry, "I am here to sing this history.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Mission is linked inextricably to humanity\'s sinfulness and need for redemption, and to God\'s provision of salvation in the person and work of Jesus Christ. This "good news" of salvation must be made known! The saving mission of Jesus constitutes the foundation for Christian mission, and the Christian gospel is its message.According to Andreas Köstenberger and Peter O\'Brien, this significant theme has rarely been given its due attention in biblical theology. Motivated by their passion to see God\'s mission carried out in today\'s world, they offer a comprehensive study of the theme of mission. In Salvation to the Ends of the Earth they explore the entire sweep of biblical history, including the Old Testament, the second-temple period, each New Testament Gospel, Paul and his writings, and the General Epistles and Revelation.Among other questions, Köstenberger and O\'Brien examine whether or not Old Testament Israel was called to mission, whether second-temple Judaism should be characterized as a missionary religion, whether Jesus limited his earthly mission to Israel or also embarked on a Gentile mission, and whether or not there is continuity between the missions of Israel and the missions of Jesus and the early church. They write, "It is our sincere hope that our Christian mission, which is first of all God\'s, will be founded on a biblical theology that takes its cue from the scriptural revelation as a whole." To that end, they offer this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume as a service to the worldwide church.Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles.

Hitchens\'s unsparing account of Western realpolitik in the end shows it to rest on delusion as well as deception. The reader will find in these pages outstanding essays on political assassination in America as well as a scathing review of the evisceration of politics by pollsters and spin-doctors. Hitchens\'s knowledge of the tortuous history of revolutions in the twentieth century helps him explain both the New York intelligentsia\'s flirtation with Trotskyism and the frailty of Communist power structures in Eastern Europe. Hitchens\'s pointed reassessments of Graham Greene, P. G. Wodehouse and C. L. R. James, or his riotous celebration of drinking and smoking, display an engaging enthusiasm and an acerbic wit.

Scott Fitzgerald stands as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century. His biographers all note the importance of his boyhood in St. Paul, where, as he put it, he lived in "a house below the average on a street above the average." Fitzgerald\'s sensitivity about wealth and position\'later made evident in such classics as The Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night--was bred of his St. Paul family and associations. F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s St. Paul is a city of winter dreams and ice palaces, lakeside parties and neighborhood hijinks. These are stories of ambition and young love, insecurity and awkwardness, where a poor boy with energy and intelligence can break into the upper classes and become a glittering success. This selection brings together the best of Fitzgerald\'s St. Paul stories\'some virtually unknown, others classics of short fiction. Patricia Hampl\'s incisive introduction traces the trajectory of Fitzgerald\'s blazing celebrity and its connections to his life in the city that gave him his best material. Headnotes by Dave Page provide specific ties between the stories and Fitzgerald\'s life in St. Paul. "Fitzgerald is a presence in St. Paul, a ghost who patrols his old neighborhood and keeps talking to us. He sits on Mrs. Porterfield\'s porch on Summit Avenue, smoking and talking about writing, and it is always that gorgeous summer just before he finished the book, hit it big, went to New York, married the girl. This lovely book sets out our claim on him. We have no Fitzgerald museum in St. Paul, no boyhood home restored--the family lived in apartments--but this book is the only monument he needs, his own stories, with historical notes, and Patricia Hampl\'s graceful shining essay for absolution, and Zelda\'s benediction." -- Garrison Keillor "These are wonderful stories, including several of the greatest Fitzgerald ever wrote. Anyone interested in Fitzgerald or the importance of place in fiction will want to read this book. And anyone who does will find it a delight." -- Scott Donaldson, author of Hemingway vs. Fitzgerald "In one of the ironies of fate of which life is so fond, the literary world knows the biography and work of F. Scott Fitzgerald better than it knows the particulars of the city where he was born. Fitzgerald loved, hated, and was obsessed by St. Paul, and in her brilliant introduction to these stories, Patricia Hampl shows us why.

The complex tones of this work made it a commercial success and a continental sensation when it first appeared in 1761, and its embodiment of Rousseau\'s system of thought, in which feelings and intellect are intertwined, redefined the function and form of fiction for decades.

Drawing upon her own experiences, well-known tales in literature, and selected narratives from Scripture, Madeleine L’Engle gently leads the way into the glorious world of story in The Rock That Is Higher.

Carefully prepared, with many corrections, this edition of Life A User\'s Manual will be the preferred reference edition for the future.

From the confessions of a racing cyclist to the plans of an avenging murderer, from a young ethnographer obsessed with a Sumatran tribe to the death of a trapeze artist, from the fears of an ex-croupier to the dreams of a sex-change pop star to an eccentric English millionaire who has devised the ultimate pastime, Life is a manual of human irony, portraying the mixed marriages of fortunes, passions and despairs, betrayals and bereavements, of hundreds of lives in Paris and around the world. But the novel is more than an extraordinary range of fictions; it is a closely observed account of life and experience. The apartment block\'s one hundred rooms are arranged in a magic square, and the book as a whole is peppered with a staggering range of literary puzzles and allusions, acrostics, problems of chess and logic, crosswords, and mathematical formula.

And Other Heretical Hints For Living Well In The New Economic Age "If you don\'\'t read this book, you\'\'re going to die stupid!"-- Dr. Laura Schlessinger The Baby Boomers are a generation of achievers: They earned college and professional degrees and are scampering up the corporate ladder or starting entrepreneurial enterprises that boost their egos and their bank accounts. They buy sensible "starter homes" and plan to parley them into impressive dream houses through smart real estate deals, all the while deftly juggling their home, family and business lives. If two incomes don\'\'t cover all life\'\'s necessities -- and necessary luxuries -- their credit cards serve as readily available genies to make wishes reality. If their ultimate rewards have always been clear -- an early and comfortable retirement and a healthy estate to leave for the children -- why are they now facing the future with fear and trepidation?In Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan \xa0 (HarperBusiness; November 1997; $25.00), financial advisers Stephen M. Pollan and Mark Levine explain the economic realities that have rendered the old rules obsolete and offer an innovative approach to financial planning that focuses on getting the maximum use out of your income and your assets during your lifetime and renouncing the foolish (and futile) quest for financial immortality. From the startling recommendation, "quit now," to the heretical "die broke," Pollan lays out the details of a complete financial revolution. "Viewing yourself and your work as one," Pollan writes, "is a tremendous financial and emotional risk." To prove that the "Self-Fulfillment Ethic" and the false belief in careers must give way to a new work ethic, Pollan cites a ready role model -- the professional athlete. Free agents in the sports world know their tenure with any team is temporary and concentrate on getting the best financial deal they can. Adopting their attitude is the key for anyone who doesn\'\'t want to remain on the sidelines in the next century. Pollan advises that work is not a holistic pursuit. The only way to increase satisfaction and/or income is to job hop with a constant eye toward a work setting that will increase skills (and therefore marketability) and improve quality of life with immediate advantages like premium health insurance, company day care, parental leave and telecommuting and flex time options. "Long term benefits, like pension plans," Pollan reminds readers, "are worthless. Most of you will be fired long before you are fully vested." What else is keeping people locked in the 20th century? Two little pieces of plastic: ATM cards and credit cards. The convenience is irresistib≤ the costs are mind-boggling. Offering a strong dose of reality, Pollan insists that spending should be difficult and uncomfortable: "You must resolve to no longer reach beyond your grasp. If you don\'\'t have the cash on hand or in your checking account to buy something... don\'\'t buy it." Pollan issues an equally important warning about the biggest purchase most people make in their lives -- real estate. Home-ownership remains an excellent tax shelter and a desirable form of enforced savings that can help generate income in later years. But with the unpredictability of the real estate market, the benefits of "serial ownership," or "trading up," have become less likely. Pollan\'\'s solution is to save your money until you can "buy your second home first," by purchasing a residence that is large enough to accommodate a growing family, aging parents and even a home business -- in short, a home designed for a lifetime. Along with demanding a new perspective on work, credit and real estate, the new economic age lays to rest the American "dream" of retirement. Not only are traditional sources of retirement money (government assistance and private pensions) drying up, but people have discovered that long-term leisure isn\'\'t all it\'\'s cracked up to be. Pollan encourages readers to shift their viewpoint and think about earned income the way they\'\'ve always thought about unearned income: It may grow, stagnate or decrease. Investing and savings should be used to generate unearned income that will supplement on-going but fluctuating earnings. Among his recommendations: Keep a liquid reserve (in Certificates of Deposit, for example), pile up tax free savings by taking full advantage of IRAs, Keoghs, SEPs or 401(k)s, stick with equity investments like stock mutual funds far longer than traditionalists recommend, insure your income with top-notch health and disability coverage and protect your family with term life insurance that gives them enough to get by so they can adjust to the loss of your income. There\'\'s one last obstacle to living well now and in the future: the obsession with inheritance. Like retirement, the desire to establish an estate is a hold-over from an earlier age and leads to unnecessary sacrifices that far outweigh any future benefits. Asserting that "every dollar that\'\'s left in your bank account after you die is a dollar wasted," Pollan outlines a plan that enables you to die broke while guaranteeing that you don\'\'t out-live your assets. His plan includes what kind of annuities to invest in for a maximum flow of income, the best ways to share your money with loved ones while you\'\'re still alive, how to get paid for living in your house and the ins-and-outs of Medicaid, Medigap, long-term care insurance and other vehicles for covering expenses at the end of life1s journey. Recognizing that accepting a theory is one thing and putting it into practice another, Pollan provides an invaluable examination of 63 different career and financial topics from the Die Broke\xa0 perspective. Throughout the book, Pollan specifies the optimum times to pursue various financial options, but stresses that it is possible to go back and accomplish most objectives before moving on to the next phase or to hold off on a step until you meet the criteria he discusses. The good news is it\'\'s never too early and never too late to live well and DIE BROKE.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780887511127': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2583741', 'Members': '6', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '2,134,637', 'Average rating': 'None', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "The language young children use is the language they learn.

However, it is not necessary to "stay tense." The president of Independent Power Systems International, John Perkins manages large-scale projects aimed at conserving energy and improving the environment. The Stress-Free Habit is the result of his twenty years of experience as a management consultant to governmental organizations and businesses in countries as diverse as Ecuador, Indonesia, Egypt, Mexico, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. The author points out that stress is all around us and, while it is often useful and even essential, it can also be extremely harmful. While other cultures incorporate very specific methods of stress management as part of their daily routines, such methods are noticeably absent from the fabric of modern Western culture.Perkins emphasizes that we can--and should--seek out these techniques wherever they are to be found and put them into practice in our own lives. Throughout his travels and contacts with a variety of native cultures, the author has observed and integrated traditional practices that have enabled him and his co-workers to manage stress effectively and achieve high levels of success. The Stress-Free Habit consolidates this practical wisdom in a simple easy-to-follow eight-step program. Those who practice it experience physical and psychological benefits, including elimination of alcohol and drug abuse, insomnia, headache, diarrhea, and nervous disorders, as well as a lower probability of heart attack. The principles of The Stress-Free Habit come to life in tales of remarkable encounters with individuals who have mastered the art of creative living. Their stories are a testament to techniques of stress management that can help you live a longer, more relaxed, and more productive life.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9780892817580': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/89407', 'Members': '207', 'Reviews': '1', 'Popularity': '99,702', 'Average rating': '(3.94)', 'Mentions': '1', 'summary': 'Selected writings from the author of Brave New World and The Doors of Perception on the role of psychedelics in society. * Includes letters and lectures by Huxley never published elsewhere. In May 1953 Aldous Huxley took four-tenths of a gram of mescaline. The mystical and transcendent experience that followed set him off on an exploration that was to produce a revolutionary body of work about the inner reaches of the human mind. Huxley was decades ahead of his time in his anticipation of the dangers modern culture was creating through explosive population increase, headlong technological advance, and militant nationalism, and he saw psychedelics as the greatest means at our disposal to "remind adults that the real world is very different from the misshapen universe they have created for themselves by means of their culture-conditioned prejudices." Much of Huxley\'s writings following his 1953 mescaline experiment can be seen as his attempt to reveal the power of these substances to awaken a sense of the sacred in people living in a technological society hostile to mystical revelations. Moksha, a Sanskrit word meaning "liberation," is a collection of the prophetic and visionary writings of Aldous Huxley.

Lewis. There are many converts to Catholicism, some very well known, who credit C.S. Lewis for playing a significant role in their conversion. This includes famous converts and writers like Peter Kreeft, Sheldon Vanauken, Thomas Howard, and Joseph Pearce. But the ironic and perplexing fact is that Lewis himself, while "Catholic" in many aspects of his faith and devotion, never became a Roman Catholic. Many have wondered why. Joseph Pearce, highly regarded literary biographer and great admirer of Lewis, is the ideal writer to try to answer that question. The relationship of Lewis to the Roman Catholic Church is an important and intriguing topic of interest to both Catholics and Protestants. Pearce delves into all the issues, questions, and factors regarding this puzzling question. He gives a broad and detailed analysis of the historical, biographical, theological, and literary pieces of this puzzle. His findings set forth the objective shape of Lewis\'s theological and spiritual works in their relation to the Catholic Church. This well-written book brings new insights into a great Christian writer, and it should spark lively discussion among Lewis readers and bring about a better understanding of the spiritual beliefs of C.S.

Its founder was Zeno of Cytium (not to be confused with Zeno of Elea, who discovered the famous paradoxes). He was born in Cyprus about 336 b.c., but all of his philosophical activity took place in Athens. For more than 500 years Stoicism was one of the most influential and fruitful philosophical movements in the Graeco-Roman world. The works of the earlier Stoics survive only in fragmentary quotations from other authors, but from the Renaissance until well into the nineteenth century, Stoic ethical thought was one of the most important ancient influences on European ethics, particularly because of the descriptions of it by Cicero, through surviving works by the Stoics Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and also Epictetus--and also because of the effect that it had had in antiquity, and continued to have into the nineteenth century, on Christian ethical views. Nowadays an undergraduate or graduate student learning about ancient philosophy in a university course may well hear only about Plato and Aristotle, along perhaps with the presocratics; but in the history of Western thought and education this situation is somewhat atypical, and in most periods a comparable student would have learned as much or more about Stoicism, as well as two other major ancient philosophical movements, Epicureanism and Scepticism. In spite of this lack of explicit acquaintance with Stoic philosophers and their works, however, most students will recognize in Epictetus various ideas that are familiar through their effects on other thinkers, notably Spinoza, in our intellectual tradition."… (more)', 'characters': ['Epictetus'], 'awards_and_honors': ['ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (1999.4|Non-fiction, 1999)']}, '9780915368600': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/137604', 'Members': '198', 'Reviews': '5', 'Popularity': '104,575', 'Average rating': '(3.79)', 'Mentions': '1', 'summary': '', 'characters': ['Folsom XXV', 'Thomas Grayson', 'W.

The stage is a vast, mysterious field of impenetrable plastic in the Brazilian rain forest set against a backdrop of rampant environmental destruction, commercialization, poverty, and religious rapture. Through the Arc of the Rainforest is narrated by a small satellite hovering permanently around the head of an innocent character named Kazumasa.

Cooper\'s hero, Natty Bumppo, is forced ever farther into the heart of the continent by the advance of civilization that he inadvertently serves as advance scout, missionary, and critic.\xa0 Leatherstocking first appears in\xa0The Pioneers\xa0(1823), as an aged hunter living on the fringe of settlement near Templeton (Cooperstown), New York, at the end of the eighteenth century. There he becomes caught in the struggles of party, family, and class to control the changing American land and to determine what sort of civilization will replace the rapidly vanishing wilderness. When Natty Bumppo started an American tradition by setting off into the sunset at the novel\'s close, one early reader said, "I longed to go with him."  The Last of the Mohicans\xa0(1826) is a pure unabashed narrative of adventure. It looks back to the earlier time of the French and Indian Wars, when Natty and his two companions, Chingachgook and Uncas, survivors of a once-proud Indian nation, attempt a daring rescue and seek to forestall the plan of the French to unleash their Mingo allies on a wave of terror through the English settlements.  The Prairie\xa0(1827) takes up Natty in his eighties, driven by the continuous march of civilization to his last refuge on the Great Plains across the Mississippi. On this vast and barren stage, the Sioux and Pawnee, the outlaw clan of Ishmael Bush, and members of the Lewis and Clark expedition enact a romantic drama of intrigue, pursuit, and biblical justice that reflects Cooper\'s historical dialectic of culture and nature, of the American nation and the American continent.

Instinctively gifted in the arts of the forest, pious in his respect for the unspoiled wilderness on which he loves to gaze, honorable to friend and foe alike, stoic under torture, and cool under fire, the young Leatherstocking emerges as Cooper\'s noblest figure of the American frontier.

With the publication of this Library of America volume, the third of three volumes, all Melville\'s fiction has now been restored to print for the first time. Pierre; or, The Ambiguities, published in 1852 (the year after\xa0Moby-Dick), moves between the idyllic Berkshire countryside and the nightmare landscape of early New York City. Its hero, a young American patrician trying to redeem the secret sins of his father, elopes to the city, discovers Bohemian life, attempts a literary epic, and struggles his way through incest, murder, and madness. Long a controversial work, it is Melville\'s darkest satire of American life and letters and one of his most powerful books. A pivotal work, both for Melville\'s career and for American literature,\xa0Pierre\xa0was followed by\xa0Israel Potter, the story of a veteran of the Revolution, victim of a thousand mischances, and a long-suffering exile in England. Along the way are memorable episodes of war and intrigue, with personal portraits of Benjamin Franklin, John Paul Jones, and George III. In the exploits of this touchingly optimistic soldier, Melville offers a scathing image of the collapse of revolutionary hopes.  The Piazza Tales\xa0demonstrates Melville\'s dazzling mastery of many styles, including "The Encantadas," about nature\'s two faces--enchanting and horrific; the famous "Bartleby the Scrivener," about a Wall Street copyist who "would prefer not to"; and the enigmatic "Benito Cereno," about a credulous Yankee sea captain who stumbles into an intricately plotted mutiny aboard a disabled slave ship.  The Confidence-Man, Melville\'s last published novel, is in many ways a forerunner of modernist American fiction. An extended meditation on faith, hope, and charity as these are manifested on board a Mississippi riverboat one April Fools\' Day, it presents a menagerie of Americans buying and selling, borrowing and lending, believing and mistrusting, as they are carried toward the auction blocks of New Orleans. Many pieces never before collected are also included: the "Authentic Anecdotes of Old Zack" (burlesque sketches of Zachary Taylor\'s Mexican campaign), "Fragments from a Writing-Desk" (Melville\'s earliest surviving prose), reviews of Hawthorne, Parkman, and Cooper, and all the tales Melville published in magazines during the 1850s. Finally, there is the posthumously published masterpiece\xa0Billy Budd, Sailor, the haunting story of a beautiful, innocent sailor who is pressed into naval service, slandered, provoked to murder, and sacrificed to military justice. While encouraging questions for which there are no answers, it invites us to meditate on the conflicts central to all Melville\'s work: between freedom and fate, innocence and civilized corruption.

They explore the tragic and comic aspects of a South haunted by its past and uncertain of its future. In the intricate, spellbinding masterpiece\xa0Absalom, Absalom!\xa0(1936), Quentin Compson descends into a vortex of images, voices, passions, and doomed desires as he and his Harvard roommate re-create the story of Thomas Sutpen and the insane ambitions, romantic hopes, and distortions of honor and conscience that trap Sutpen and those around him, until their grief and pride and fate become the inescapable and unbearable legacy of a past that is not dead and not even past. In seven episodes,\xa0The Unvanquished\xa0(1938) recounts the ordeals and triumphs of the Sartoris family during and after the Civil War as seen through the maturing consciousness of young Bayard Sartoris. The indomitable Granny Millard, the honor-driven patriarch Colonel Sartoris, the quick-witted and inventive Ringo, the ferociously heroic Drusilla, and the scheming, mendacious Ab Snopes embody the inheritance that Bayard must reconcile with a new, but diminished, South. If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem\xa0(published in 1939 as\xa0The Wild Palms) tells of desperate lovers fleeing convention and of a convict escaping the chaos of passion. In "The Wild Palms," an emotional and geographic odyssey ends in a Mississippi coastal town. In counterpoint, "Old Man" recounts the adventures of an inarticulate "tall convict" swept to freedom by a raging Mississippi flood, but who then fights to return to his simple prison life. In\xa0The Hamlet\xa0(1940), the first book of the great Snopes family trilogy, the outrageous scheming energy of Flem Snopes and his relatives is vividly and hilariously juxtaposed with the fragile communal customs of Frenchman\'s Bend. Here are Ike Snopes, in love with a cow, the sexual adventures of Eula Varner Snopes, and the wild saturnalia of the spotted horses auction, a comic masterpiece. The Library of America edition of Faulkner\'s work publishes for the first time new, corrected texts of\xa0The Unvanquished,\xa0If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem, and\xa0The Hamlet. (The corrected text of\xa0Absalom, Absalom!\xa0was published by Random House in 1986.) Manuscripts, typescripts, galleys, and published editions have been collated to produce versions that are faithful to Faulkner\'s intentions and free of the changes introduced by subsequent editors.

Widely acclaimed as the country\'s foremost philosopher, the first of its psychologists, and a champion of religious pluralism, his influence on American thought is as strong now as it has ever been. James\'s emphasis on the creative power of faith, will, and action, his opening up of philosophy to the fresh air of ordinary experience, his fascination with alternative forms of belief and states of consciousness, and his impatience with dogmas of any kind all make him a defender of individual experience and earn him a place beside Emerson and Whitman as an exponent of American democratic culture. Psychology: Briefer Course\xa0(1892) is far more than a shortened version of his monumental\xa0Principles of Psychology. It significantly revises parts of the earlier work and adds important new materials. (Students liked to call the longer book "James" and the shorter one "Jimmy.") James\'s new psychology moved away from discussions of the soul, morality, and logic, and focused instead on instinct, will, and the importance of action and habit. Passages comparing human consciousness to "a wonderful stream" inspired the "stream of consciousness" in the future work of Joyce, Woolf, and Gertrude Stein, a student of James\'s at Harvard. The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy\xa0(1897) advances the argument that each of us has the right to believe in hypotheses that are not susceptible to proof, and that such beliefs might actually change the world. The conversational style of theses essays reflects their origin in public lectures, as well as James\'s conviction that truth can be discovered as much in the course of everyday life as in the activities of science or of philosophical speculation. Talks to Teachers and to Students\xa0(1899), also drawn from lectures, helped transform the emerging science of education. Here James applies his new psychology to classroom theory and conduct, especially for the primary grades. This immensely influential book has never gone out of print. It emphasizes the role in learning of instinct, play, and habit, along with the importance of engaging the voluntary interests of students. James\'s warm and sympathetic nature informs his treatment of children, who can best be taught by those who respect the child\'s autonomy and who avoid what he calls "hammering in." "Human Immortality" (1897) defends the possibility of life after death; eight more of James\'s most important essays round out this volume devoted to a writer called by John Dewey, "almost a Columbus of the inner world."

Arranged chronologically and containing many pieces restored to the form in which Twain intended them to appear, the volumes show with unprecedented clarity the literary evolution of Mark Twain over six decades of his career. This volume contains eighty pieces from the years 1891 to 1910, when Twain emerged from bankruptcy and personal tragedy to become the white-suited, cigar-smoking international celebrity who reported on his own follies and those of humanity with an unerring sense of the absurd. Some stories display Twain\'s fascination with money and greed, such as "The Esquimau Maiden\'s Romance" and "The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg." Other stories, written after the death of his daughter Susy in 1896, explore the outer limits of fantasy and psychic phenomena, including "Which Was the Dream?" "The Great Dark," and "My Platonic Sweetheart." The United States military involvement in Cuba, China, and the Philippines turned Twain\'s attention to political satire and invective. "To the Person Sitting in Darkness," "The United States of Lyncherdom," "The Czar\'s Soliloquy," and "The War Prayer" are biting denunciations of European and American imperialism. Other political issues inspired articles and stories about the Jews, the notorious Dreyfus case, and vivisection. Twain\'s increasingly unorthodox religious opinions are powerfully, often comically, expressed in "Extracts from Adam\'s Diary," "Eve\'s Diary," "Eve Speaks," "Adam\'s Soliloquy," "A Humane Word from Satan," "What is Man?" "Extract from Captain Stormfield\'s Visit to Heaven," and "Letters from the Earth." "Against the assault of laughter," he said, "nothing can stand." Twain\'s brilliant inventiveness continues to shine in such later comic masterpieces as "Fenimore Cooper\'s Literary Offences," "Italian Without a Master," "Hunting the Deceitful Turkey," and "My First Lie and How I Got Out of It." A posthumous collection of proverbs and aphorisms ("More Maxims of Mark") is included as an appendix. The publishing history of every story, sketch, and speech in this volume has been thoroughly researched, and in each instance the most authoritative text has been reproduced. This collection also includes an extensive chronology of Twain\'s complex life, helpful notes on the people and events referred to in his works, and a guide to the texts.

James begins his tour of the French countryside one rainy morning in mid-September of 1882, when he sets off for the city of Tours as a means of exploring the proposition that "though France might be Paris, Paris was by no means France." From Tours, Balzac\'s birthplace, James travels to the great chateaux of the Loire Valley, visiting Chambord, Amboise, Chenonceaux, and Blois, where, as you cross the threshold, "you step straight into the sunshine and storm of the French Renaissance." Dense with literary associations and historical echoes, James\'s prose brings castles and cathedrals and old walled towns to life. In his glancingly precise visual evocations of terrain and cityscape, he realizes his ambition "to sketch without a palette or brushes." Henry James loved Italy, "a beautiful disheveled nymph" to England\'s "good married matron." The incisive and witty essays in\xa0Italian Hours\xa0(1909) describe memorably happy sojourns in Venice, Rome, and Florence, and excursions to Siena, Assisi, Perugia, Capri, Ravenna, and other Italian cities. "Nowhere do art and life seem so interfused" as in Venice, wrote James in celebration of the splendor of Venetian light and color, air, and history. He records his radiant impressions of Roman churches and aqueducts, museums and fountains, and rambles through the gardens of the Villa Borghese in spring, when Rome seems lighted "with an irresistible smile." All these essays are filled with James\'s intense pleasure in Italian places and people. This volume concludes with sixteen essays on such varied places as Switzerland, Holland, Rheims, and the Pyrénées, including a memorable account of the American volunteer ambulance corps in Europe during World War One.

His challenge is to take subjects like geology, chemistry, paleontology, astronomy, and particle physics and see if there isn't some way to render them comprehensible to people, like himself, made bored (or scared) stiff of science by school. His interest is not simply to discover what we know but to find out how we know it. How do we know what is in the center of the earth, thousands of miles beneath the surface? How can we know the extent and the composition of the universe, or what a black hole is? How can we know where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out?

Do you really like the way you look and feel? Are you consistently enjoying great health and high energy?Bill Phillips, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Body-for-LIFE, believes your answer to all of the above questions should be, "Yes!" He feels that food should be a source of pure pleasure. A source of positive, abundant energy! A "sure thing" in a world of much uncertainty.Phillips, who\'s widely regarded as today\'s most successful fitness author, has firm beliefs which go against the grain of today\'s popular weight-loss methods. "Diets, all of them, are potentially dangerous, most always dumb and ultimately a dead-end street!" he insists. "Eventually, anyone and everyone who\'s at all concerned with their health must learn how to feed their body, not how to starve it."Instead, Phillips encourages a safe and sound solution which includes eating balanced, nutrient-rich meals, frequently throughout the day. "This is whatworks in the long run," he explains.Rich with common sense and science, Eating for Life has rhyme and reason. It is specific. There are very clear dos and don\'ts which help people enjoy food and improve their overall fitness.Bill\'s approach, which he calls the "Eating for Lifestyle," has already helped thousands of people break free from the dieting dilemma and discover that, contrary to pop-culture belief, food is friend, not foe. Used intelligently, it nourishes the body and mind, satisfies the appetite, calms cravings, renews health and lifts energy.Like Bill Phillips\' Body-for-LIFE, this is a tell-it-like-it-is book.

Environmental Studies. Photographs by Saxon Holt. Illustrations by Richard Pembroke. This lavishly illustrated book celebrates the challenges and opportunities of gardening in Mediterranean climates, with special reference to northern California\'s San Francisco Bay Region. The core of the book is a catalog of more than 650 plants suited to regions with mild, usually wet winters and dry, often hot summers. These plants thrive with moderate to no summer irrigation when established, require little or no maintenance, and are reasonably available from nurseries, botanic gardens, native plant sales, or specialty seed suppliers. Many of the 542 color photographs show plants in garden settings to suggest attractive and compatible plant combinations. Summary charts provide information on each plant, such as bloom time, needs for water and sun, and preferences for coastal or inland microclimates. Lists suggest plants for special situations, such as hot sites, dryish shade, small gardens, and clay soils. Chapters on landscape design and maintenance inspire readers to make gardens that use little water and no harmful chemicals, with a focus on building healthy soil. Practical steps to successful design are supplemented with ideas for designing with microclimate, attracting wildlife, and fire safety. Sidebars by local experts discuss weather, natural landscapes, design solutions, and gardening with recycled water. "A valuable resource for climate-compatible gardening in the San Franciso Bay Area that will also be of interest to gardeners in other parts of the world with a similar seasonal pattern of winter rain and dry summers. This book will occupy a prominent place in my library for many years to come."--Katherine Greenberg, president Mediterranean Garden Society "This book is beautifully designed with abundant photographs of plants, many in garden settings, and it is packed with the kind of information gardeners need for their own special situations.

The Steppe--the most lyrical of the five--is an account of a nine-year-old boy's frightening journey by wagon train across the steppe of southern Russia. The Duel sets two decadent figures--a fanatical rationalist and a man of literary sensibility--on a collision course that ends in a series of surprising reversals. In The Story of an Unknown Man, a political radical spying on an important official by serving as valet to his son gradually discovers that his own terminal illness has changed his long-held priorities in startling ways. Three Years recounts a complex series of ironies in the personal life of a rich but passive Moscow merchant. In My Life, a man renounces wealth and social position for a life of manual labor. The resulting conflict between the moral simplicity of his ideals and the complex realities of human nature culminates in a brief apocalyptic vision that is unique in Chekhov's work.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781400032952': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/14537', 'Members': '1,225', 'Reviews': '37', 'Popularity': '11,708', 'Average rating': '(3.68)', 'Mentions': '22', 'summary': "James Gleick has long been fascinated by the making of science -- how ideas order visible appearances, how equations can give meaning to molecular and stellar phenomena, how theories can transform what we see.

In this original, sweeping, and intimate biography, Gleick moves between a comprehensive historical portrait and a dramatic focus on Newton's significant letters and unpublished notebooks to illuminate the real importance of his work in physics, in optics, and in calculus. He makes us see the old intuitive, alchemical universe out of which Newton's mathematics first arose and shows us how Newton's ideas have altered all forms of understanding from history to philosophy. And he gives us a moving account of the conflicting impulses that pulled at this man's heart: his quiet longings, his rage, his secrecy, the extraordinary subtleties of a personality that were mirrored in the invisible forces he first identified as the building blocks of science.

Could there be other universes? In Parallel Worlds, world-renowned physicist and bestselling author Michio Kaku-an author who "has a knack for bringing the most ethereal ideas down to earth" (Wall Street Journal)-takes readers on a fascinating tour of cosmology, M-theory, and its implications for the fate of the universe. In his first book of physics since Hyperspace, Michio Kaku begins by describing the extraordinary advances that have transformed cosmology over the last century, and particularly over the last decade, forcing scientists around the world to rethink our understanding of the birth of the universe, and its ultimate fate. In Dr. Kaku\'s eyes, we are living in a golden age of physics, as new discoveries from the WMAP and COBE satellites and the Hubble space telescope have given us unprecedented pictures of our universe in its infancy. As astronomers wade through the avalanche of data from the WMAP satellite, a new cosmological picture is emerging. So far, the leading theory about the birth of the universe is the "inflationary universe theory," a major refinement on the big bang theory. In this theory, our universe may be but one in a multiverse, floating like a bubble in an infinite sea of bubble universes, with new universes being created all the time. A parallel universe may well hover a mere millimeter from our own. The very idea of parallel universes and the string theory that can explain their existence was once viewed with suspicion by scientists, seen as the province of mystics, charlatans, and cranks. But today, physicists overwhelmingly support string-theory, and its latest iteration, M-theory, as it is this one theory that, if proven correct, would reconcile the four forces of the universe simply and elegantly, and answer the question "What happened before the big bang?" Already, Kaku explains, the world\'s foremost physicists and astronomers are searching for ways to test the theory of the multiverse using highly sophisticated wave detectors, gravity lenses, satellites, and telescopes. The implications of M-theory are fascinating and endless. If parallel worlds do exist, Kaku speculates, in time, perhaps a trillion years or more from now, as appears likely, when our universe grows cold and dark in what scientists describe as a big freeze, advanced civilizations may well find a way to escape our universe in a kind of "inter-dimensional lifeboat." An unforgettable journey into black holes and time machines, alternate universes, and multidimensional space, Parallel Worlds gives us a compelling portrait of the revolution sweeping the world of cosmology.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['Royal Society Prize for Science Books Shortlist (General, 2006)']}, '9781400033829': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/32461', 'Members': '1,204', 'Reviews': '38', 'Popularity': '11,950', 'Average rating': '(3.73)', 'Mentions': '46', 'summary': 'This novel follows the lives of two 11-year-olds intent on escaping childhood.

"On the morning of September 11, 2001, the world witnessed the terrible result of that intelligence failure with the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the wake of those attacks, Americans were left wondering how such an obviously long-term, globally coordinated plot could have escaped detection by the CIA and taken the nation by surprise. Robert Baer was not surprised. A twenty-one-year veteran of the CIA\'s Directorate of Operations who had left the agency in 1997, Baer observed firsthand how an increasingly bureaucratic CIA lost its way in the post-cold war world and refused to adequately acknowledge and neutralize the growing threat of Islamic fundamentalist terror in the Middle East and elsewhere." "A throwback to the days when CIA operatives got results by getting their hands dirty and running covert operations, Baer spent his career chasing down leads on suspected terrorists in the world\'s most volatile hot spots. As he and his agents risked their lives gathering intelligence, he watched as the CIA reduced drastically its operations overseas, failed to put in place people who knew local languages and customs, and rewarded workers who knew how to play the political games of the agency\'s suburban Washington headquarters but not how to recruit agents on the ground."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Rome, 1520. The Eternal City is in mourning. Raphael Sanzio, beloved painter and national hero, has died suddenly at the height of his fame. His body lies in state at the splendid marble Pantheon. At the nearby convent of Sant\'Apollonia, a young woman comes to the Mother Superior, seeking refuge. She is Margherita Luti, a baker\'s daughter from a humble neighborhood on the Tiber, now an outcast from Roman society, persecuted by powerful enemies within the Vatican. Margherita was Raphael\'s beloved and appeared as the Madonna in many of his paintings. Theirs was a love for the ages. But now that Raphael is gone, the convent is her only hope of finding an honest and peaceful life. The Mother Superior agrees to admit Margherita to their order. But first, she must give up the ruby ring she wears on her left hand, the ring she had worn in Raphael\'s scandalous nude "engagement portrait." The ring has a storied past, and it must be returned to the Church or Margherita will be cast out into the streets. Behind the quiet walls of the convent, Margherita makes her decision . . . and remembers her life with Raphael--and the love and torment--embodied in that one precious jewel.

Macon Detornay is a suburban white boy possessed and politicized by black culture, and filled with rage toward white America. After moving to New York City for college, Macon begins robbing white passengers in his taxicab, setting off a manhunt for the black man presumed to be committing the crimes. When his true identity is revealed, Macon finds himself to be a celebrity and makes use of the spotlight to hold forth on the evils and invisibility of whiteness. Soon he launches the Race Traitor Project, a stress-addled collective that attracts guilty liberals, wannabe gangstas, and bandwagon riders from all over the country to participate in a Day of Apology--a day set aside for white people to make amends for four hundred years of oppression. The Day of Apology pushes New York City over the edge into an epic riot, forcing Macon to confront the depth of his own commitment to the struggle.

In Papua New Guinea, a primitive tribe is nearly obliterated by a sickness whose chief symptom is uncontrollable laughter. Across Europe, millions of sheep rub their fleeces raw before collapsing. In England, cows attack their owners in the milking parlors, while in the American West, thousands of deer starve to death in fields full of grass. What these strange conditions-including fatal familial insomnia, kuru, scrapie, and mad cow disease-share is their cause: prions. Prions are ordinary proteins that sometimes go wrong, resulting in neurological illnesses that are always fatal. Even more mysterious and frightening, prions are almost impossible to destroy because they are not alive and have no DNA-and the diseases they bring are now spreading around the world. In The Family That Couldn\'t Sleep, essayist and journalist D. T. Max tells the spellbinding story of the prion\'s hidden past and deadly future. Through exclusive interviews and original archival research, Max explains this story\'s connection to human greed and ambition-from the Prussian chemist Justus von Liebig, who made cattle meatier by feeding them the flesh of other cows, to New Guinean natives whose custom of eating the brains of the dead nearly wiped them out. The biologists who have investigated these afflictions are just as extraordinary-for example, Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, a self-described "pedagogic pedophiliac pediatrician" who cracked kuru and won the Nobel Prize, and another Nobel winner, Stanley Prusiner, a driven, feared self-promoter who identified the key protein that revolutionized prion study. With remarkable precision, grace, and sympathy, Max-who himself suffers from an inherited neurological illness-explores maladies that have tormented humanity for centuries and gives reason to hope that someday cures will be found. And he eloquently demonstrates that in our relationship to nature and these ailments, we have been our own worst enemy.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['Salon Book Award (2006)']}, '9781400062645': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/335059', 'Members': '45', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '442,581', 'Average rating': '(3.33)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "What would you write if no one knew who you were?In the spirit of the demolition derby, where drivers take heedless risks with reckless abandon, welcome to the first convocation of the Secret Society of Demolition Writers.

Equally diverse and surprising are the authors themselves: Aimee Bender, Benjamin Cheever, Michael Connelly, Sebastian Junger, Elizabeth McCracken, Rosie O'Donnell, Chris Offutt, Anna Quindlen, John Burnham Schwartz, Alice Sebold, Lauren Slater, and Marc Parent, the editor of the collection.

Those words, whispered to ten-year-old Tim Tyson by one of his playmates in the late spring of 1970, heralded a firestorm that would forever transform the small tobacco market town of Oxford, North Carolina. On May 11, 1970, Henry Marrow, a 23-year-old black veteran, walked into a crossroads store owned by Robert Teel, a rough man with a criminal record and ties to the Ku Klux Klan, and came out running. Teel and two of his sons chased Marrow, beat him unmercifully, and killed him in public as he pleaded for his life. In the words of a local prosecutor: They shot him like you or I would kill a snake. Like many small Southern towns, Oxford had barely been touched by the civil rights movement. But in the wake of the killing, young African Americans took to the streets, led by 22-year-old Ben Chavis, a future president of the NAACP. As mass protests crowded the town square, a cluster of returning Vietnam veterans organized what one termed a military operation. While lawyers battled in the courthouse that summer in a drama that one termed a Perry Mason kind of thing, the Ku Klux Klan raged in the shadows and black veterans torched the town's tobacco warehouses. With large sections of the town in flames, Tyson's father, the pastor of Oxford's all-white Methodist church, pressed his congregation to widen their vision of humanity and pushed the town to come to terms with its bloody racial history. In the end, however, the Tyson family was forced to move away. Years later, historian Tim Tyson returned to Oxford to ask Robert Teel why he and his sons had killed Henry Marrow. That nigger committed suicide, coming in here wanting to four-letter-word my daughter-in-law, Teel explained. The black radicals who burned much of Oxford also told Tim their stories. It was like we had a cash register up there at the pool hall, just ringing up how much money we done cost these white people, one of them explained. We knew if we cost 'em enough goddamn money they was gonna start changing some things. In the tradition of To Kill a Mockingbird, Blood Done Sign My Name is a classic work of conscience, a defining portrait of a time and place that we will never forget. Tim Tyson's riveting narrative of that fiery summer and one family's struggle to build bridges in a time of destruction brings gritty blues truth, soaring gospel vision, and down-home humor to our complex history, where violence and faith, courage and evil, despair and hope all mingle to illuminate America's enduring chasm of race.

How do we know about the past? Does an objective historical truth exist and can we ever access it? In answering these central questions, John Tosh argues that, despite the impression of fragmentation created by postmodernism in recent years, history is a coherent discipline which still bears the imprint of its nineteenth-century origins. Consistently clear-sighted, he provides a lively and compelling guide to a complex and sometimes controversial subject, while making his readers vividly aware of just how far our historical knowledge is conditioned by the character of the sources and the methods of the historians who work on them. The sixth edition has been revised and updated with key new material including: - a brand new chapter on public history - sections on digitised sources and historical controversy - discussion of topics including transnational history and the nature of the archive - an expanded range of examples and case studies - a comprehensive companion website providing valuable supporting material, study questions and a bank of primary sources. Lucid and engaging, this edition retains all the user-friendly features that have helped to make this book a favourite with both students and lecturers, including marginal glosses, illustrations and suggestions for further reading.

I would not have been interested in accepting the part in the Archer version, because the lines were too stiffly artificial and lacked conviction. The Thornton Wilder adaptation, however, has restored life and credibility to a drama, which is still one of the finest efforts in our theatrical literature." -Ruth Gordon, Cincinnati Times-Star, October 27, 1937 "It\'s a thrill to encounter this collaboration between these two pioneers of modern theater. Wilder has created a brilliant version of Ibsen\'s great play, which is taut, conversational and pulsing with life nearly eighty years after it was written. Of course, Wilder worked on A Doll\'s House while writing Our Town. There are incredible echoes between Nora and Emily-two young women who poignantly confront their own mortality and must say good-bye to life as they know it." -Arin Arbus, director, A Doll\'s House, Theatre for a New Audience, May 1, 2016 Not staged until 2016, since its record-breaking Broadway premiere starring Ruth Gordon in 1937, this is the first publication of the adaptation of Ibsen\'s classic drama as revitalized through the shrewd lens of American drama master Thornton Wilder. With clarifying dialogue, Wilder uproots this classic from Norway and funnels it through an American lens. The marriage of Ibsen\'s naturalistic style melds with Wilder\'s knack for emotional nuance to create a demonstrative edition of the revered A Doll\'s House. Henrik Ibsen is often referred to as the father of modern realism. He is most well known for his plays Hedda Gabler, Ghosts, The Master Builder, The Wild Duck, Peer Gynt, and An Enemy of the People. Thornton Wilder is considered to be one of the most accomplished American playwrights and novelists of the twentieth century. He received three Pulitzer Prize Awards for Our Town (1938), The Skin of Our Teeth (1943) and The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1928). His novel The Eighth Day received The National Book Award in 1968.

It\'s the best relationship advice you\'ll ever receive. For ages, women have come together over coffee, cocktails, or late-night phone chats to analyze the puzzling behavior of men. He\'s afraid to get hurt again. Maybe he doesn\'t want to ruin the friendship. Maybe he\'s intimidated by me. He just got out of a relationship. Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo are here to say that--despite good intentions--you\'re wasting your time. Men are not complicated, although they\'d like you to think they are. And there are no mixed messages. The truth may be, He\'s just not that into you. Unfortunately, guys are too terrified to ever directly tell a woman, "You\'re not the one." But their actions absolutely show how they feel. Reexamining familiar scenarios and classic mindsets that keep us in unsatisfying relationships, Behrendt and Tuccillo\'s wise and wry understanding of the sexes spares women hours of waiting by the phone, obsessing over the details with sympathetic girlfriends, and hoping his mixed messages really mean, "I\'m in love with you and want to be with you." He\'s Just Not That Into You is provocative, hilarious, and, above all, intoxicatingly liberating. It deserves a place on every woman\'s night table. It knows you\'re a beautiful, smart, funny woman who deserves better. The next time you feel the need to start "figuring him out," consider the glorious thought that maybe, He\'s just not that into you. And then set yourself loose to go find the one who is. This NEWLY EXPANDED EDITION includes: a new foreword from Greg Behrendt; a new chapter--providing an honest look at the stages of life after He\'s Just Not That Into You, according to Liz, including exaltation, loneliness, temptation, and balance; and Greg and Liz address the most frequently asked reader questions.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781417699674': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/61180', 'Members': '2,380', 'Reviews': '80', 'Popularity': '4,688', 'Average rating': '(3.78)', 'Mentions': '29', 'summary': 'Follows the adventures of Kristy and the other members of the Baby-sitters Club as they deal with crank calls, uncontrollable two-year-olds, wild pets, and parents who do not always tell the truth.', 'characters': ['Kristy Thomas', 'Claudia Kishi', 'Mary Anne Spier', 'Stacey McGill', 'Jamie Newton', 'Mimi', 'David Michael Thomas', 'Sam Thomas', 'Charlie Thomas', 'Janine Kishi'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781419154072': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/29428', 'Members': '2,003', 'Reviews': '21', 'Popularity': '6,015', 'Average rating': '(3.93)', 'Mentions': '24', 'summary': '\'Yes, what is Dionysian? - This book provides an answer - "a man who knows" speaks in it, the initiate and disciple of his god.\'The Birth of Tragedy (1872) is a book about the origins of Greek tragedy and its relevance to the German culture of its time. For Nietzsche, Greek tragedy is the expression of a culture which has achieved a delicate but powerful balance between Dionysian insight into the chaos and suffering whichunderlies all existence and the discipline and clarity of rational Apollonian form. In order to promote a return to these values, Nietzsche undertakes a critique of the complacent rationalism of late nineteenth-century German culture and makes an impassioned plea for the regenerative potential ofthe music of Wagner. In its wide-ranging discussion of the nature of art, science and religion, Nietzsche\'s argument raises important questions about the problematic nature of cultural origins which are still of concern today.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['1000 Books to Read Before You Die (2018)']}, '9781419317262': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2930', 'Members': '39,927', 'Reviews': '1262', 'Popularity': '29', 'Average rating': '(3.89)', 'Mentions': '1158', 'summary': "Despite his overwhelming fear of interacting with people, Christopher, a mathematically-gifted, autistic fifteen-year-old boy, decides to investigate the murder of a neighbor's dog and uncovers secret information about his mother.", 'characters': ['Christopher John Francis Boone', 'Ed Boone', 'Roger Shears', 'Mrs. Shears', 'Mrs. Alexander', 'Siobhan', 'Reverend Gascoyne'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Alex Award (2004)', 'IBBY Honour Book (2006.3|Slovenian Translation, 2006)', 'Whitbread (Novel, 2003)', 'Whitbread Book of the Year (2003)', "Commonwealth Writers' Prize (Overall Best First Book, 2004)", "Guardian Children's Fiction Prize (2003)", '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (2006/2008 Edition)', 'Whitcoulls top 100, 2008 (59)', 'New York Times bestseller (Fiction, 2003)', 'Salon Book Award (2003)', 'Guardian 1000 (Comedy)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Honor Book (Adult Fiction Honor Book, 2004)', 'ALA Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults (2006.02|What Ails you?, 2006)', 'ALA Best Books for Young Adults (2004)', 'Exclusive Books Boeke Prize (2004)', 'ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (2009.3|Social Sciences, 2004; Literature & Language Arts, 2009)', 'Booker Prize Longlist (2003)', "1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up (2009.0982|2009, Ages 12↑)", 'Abraham Lincoln Illinois High School Book Award Nominee (2006)', 'ALA Notable Books for Adults (2004)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize (2003.06|Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction, 2003)', 'Waverton Good Read Award (2003)', 'Village Voice 25 Favorite Books (2003)', 'Today Show Book Club selection (13)', 'Amazon.com Best Books (2003)', 'World Book Night selection (2011)', 'Carnegie Medal Shortlist (2003)', 'Whitcoulls top 100, 2010 (37)', "501 Must-Read Books (Children's Fiction)", 'South Bank Show Annual Award for Literature (2004)', 'McKitterick Prize (2004)', 'Museums, Libraries, and Archives Society\'s "30 Books Every Adult Should Read Before They Die" (11)', 'Books of the Decade: The 50 books that defined the decade (2000)', "Dolly Gray Children's Literature Award (2004)", 'TLA Tayshas High School Reading List (2003)', 'VDL Green Mountain Book Award Nominee (2006)', 'New Hampshire Flume Award Nominee (2006)', 'Garden State Teen Book Award (2006.2|Grades 9-12, 2006)', 'The White Ravens (English / Great Britain, 2004)', 'The Great American Read (66)', 'The Economist Best Books (2003.3)']}, '9781419542206': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/13426643', 'Members': '56', 'Reviews': '2', 'Popularity': '363,579', 'Average rating': '(2.86)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'Presents the story of Hester Prynne, a young wife in seventeenth-century New England who is condemned by Puritan law to wear a scarlet A as the symbol of the sin she has committed.', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781419950582': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/2081940', 'Members': '9', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '1,603,160', 'Average rating': 'None', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': '"Elgin Collier, AKA Gillian Shelby, is the world\'s most popular women\'s erotica author.

Despite its grim theme, or more likely because of the centrality of that theme to the deepest fears of our own age, this is one of the relatively few Greek tragedies that regularly finds its way to the stage. Here the power of Euripides' theatrical and moral imagination speaks clearly across the twenty-five centuries that separate our world from his. The theme is really a double one: the suffering of the victims of war, exemplified by the woman who survive the fall of Troy, and the degradation of the victors, shown by the Greeks' reckless and ultimately self-destructive behavior. It offers an enduring picture of human fortitude in the midst of despair. Trojan Women gains special relevance, of course, in times of war. It presents a particularly intense account of human suffering and uncertainty, but one that is also rooted in considerations of power and policy, morality and expedience. Furthermore, the seductions of power and the dangers both of its exercise and of resistance to it as portrayed in Trojan Women are not simply philosophical or rhetorical gambits but part of the lived experience of Euripides' day. And their analogues in our own day lie all too close at hand.

The novel follows Alice down a rabbit-hole and into a surreal world of strange and wonderful characters who constantly turn everything upside-down with their mind-boggling logic and word play, and their fantastic parodies. Carroll's fable illustrates his masterful ability to weave logic with nonsense in a tale that continues to delight all ages.While this great classic is widely available, the Broadview edition is unique. Richard Kelly combines Alice's Adventures in Wonderland not with the later (and largely distinct) work Through the Looking Glass but rather with Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Lewis Carroll's first version of the story. Readers are thus able to trace the literary revisions, and to compare Caroll's own illustrations in the original with the famous John Tenniel illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since.

AIMÉ CÉSAIRE was a world-renowned poet, essayist and dramatist, whose best known works include Notebook of a Return to My Native Land, The Tragedy of King Christophe and A Season in the Congo. He was the founding editor of Tropiques, which was instrumental in establishing the use of surrealism as a political weapon. He co-formulated the concept of "negritude," which urges black Africans to reject assimilation and cultivate consciousness of their racial qualities and heritage. Césaire held a number of government positions in his native Martinique, including that of mayor of Fort-de-France. Césaire died in 2008. RICHARD MILLER has translated many books, both nonfiction and fiction, including works by Roland Barthes, Brassa? and Albert Camus, as well as poetry, many articles and a number of plays.

This religion, called Heathenry, is one of the fastest growing polytheistic religious movements in the United States today. This book provides a thorough guide to the cosmology, values, ethics, and rituals practiced by modern Heathens. It crosses denominational lines, examining practices common to all branches of Heathenry in an easily accessible format. Readers will have the opportunity to explore the sacred stories of the various Heathen Gods, like Odin, Frigga, Freya, and Thor, and the devotional practices of modern votaries. The most common devotional rite - the faining or blot - is examined in rich detail, with examples given for personal use. Additionally, readers are introduced to the concept of wyrd or fate, so integral to the Heathen worldview. For those new to Heathenry, Pagans who wish to learn more about the Norse Deities, or those simply interested in learning about this unique religion, Exploring the Northern Tradition is the perfect introduction. Subjects covered include: - The gods and goddesses - Symbel - The soul matrix - Ethics and values of the modern heathen - The history and evolution of modern Heathenry. Unlike many books on Heathenry, Exploring the Northern Tradition is not denomination specific, nor does it seek to overwhelm the reader with unfamiliar Anglo-Saxon or Norse terminology. Every new concept covered is presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. Readers will come away from this book with a thorough knowledge of what the Heathen community is like and what newcomers to that community can expect. Experienced Heathens will find a wealth of lore and inter-denominational critique that will make this book an excellent addition to their libraries. The author, Galina Krasskova draws on her own 12 years of experience as a Heathen priest or weofodthignen. She is currently Aeweweard in Thaet Angelseaxisce Ealdriht and has studied interfaith ministry in NYC (where she is registered with the state as a minister). Drawing upon the foundation of her own experience as a Heathen, Rev.

In a sweeping panorama, Haruko Taya and Theodore Cook take us from the Japanese attacks on China in the 1930s to the Japanese homefront during the inhuman raids on Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, offering the first glimpses of how this century's most violent conflict affected the lives of the Japanese population. Japan at War documents a huge range of experiences, from long-ago memories of being taught to play at soldiering in school to personal accounts of carrying out horrendous medical experiments and ruthless massacres. Here are the soldiers and sailors caught in the jungles of New Guinea and on the seas around the Philippines. Here, too, are proud builders of the Burma railway, and unrepentant generals, as well as conscripts whose political or intellectual training made them unwilling participants in the horrors wrought by their country. Japanese newspapermen, filmmakers, artists, cabaret dancers, and diplomats speak candidly about their wartime experiences, adding a whole new dimension to the now-famous symbols of kamikaze pilots and human torpedoes. As they crisscrossed Japan seeking out survivors of a war that cost that country over 3 million lives, the authors encountered every form of human response: those who held to their principles and those who gave in to opportunism, those who controlled events as well as the many - including women and children - who were caught up in the horrific whirlpool.

Many of his essays reflect his continuing interest in the conventions of popular culture as well as the philosophy of science and history, particularly as they inform developments in art and politics. But his larger concerns oscillate between empirical science and the particulars of social history, on the one hand, and his need for a grounding of absolute truth that would transcend both. His critique of politics and the prevailing ideologies of fascism and capitalism overlaps with his attempt to locate a foundational truth in a world of change and diversity. He embraced a form of political pacifism that intersected with an increasing attraction to religious quietism and mysticism.

Against the steady flow of stories highlighting "mainline decline," The Practicing Congregation suggested that there is a new and often overlooked renaissance occurring in mainline Protestant churches. The success of The Practicing Congregation made it clear that the next step was to provide examples that would illustrate the concepts laid out in that initial work. In From Nomads to Pilgrims, the editors continue to build this narrative, gathering specific stories of congregational vitality and transformation from participants in their research at the Project on Congregations of Intentional Practice, a Lilly Endowment Inc. funded study at Virginia Theological Seminary. Including stories from a variety of faith traditions across the U.S., From Nomads to Pilgrims explores: how intentional congregations develop ; how they negotiate the demands of interpreting traditional Christian practices in a postmodern culture ; how these practices lead to congregational and personal transformation. Each chapter is an instructive case study, illustrating a unique expression of the vitality experienced by a congregation that intentionally reclaims a traditional Christian practice.

One of the leading forces of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston was also one of the most widely acclaimed Black authors in America from the mid twenties to the mid forties. She faded into obscurity in the subsequent decades, but literary figures and scholars in the 1970s revived her work and introduced a whole generation to her brilliance. Today she is the most widely taught Black woman writer in the canon of American literature. Born in the all-Black town of Eatonville, Florida, of which her father was mayor, Hurston was intensely proud. She became the first Black student at Barnard College, where she earned a bachelor\'s degree in anthropology. She conducted significant research, interviews, and fieldwork relating to Black cultures of the United States and the Caribbean. In her writings, instead of bemoaning the frustrations of the Black experience, Hurston chose to celebrate the many cultures of her people as well as the richness of their verbal expressions. Although Hurston died poor and forgotten in 1960, the visibility of the feminist movement and the interest of women writers such as Alice Walker - who was responsible for providing a headstone for Hurston\'s unmarked grave in 1974 - were instrumental in reestablishing Hurston\'s place in African-American literature. Hurston\'s life and work are revealed through the reviews and essays contained in Zora Neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past and Present. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and K.A. Appiah have chosen reviews of her works from such important publications of her days as The Crisis, New Masses, New Republic, the New York Herald Tribune, The New York Times Book Review, Opportunity, and Saturday Review of Literature. Hurston\'s first novel, Jonah\'s Gourd Vine (1934), earned comments ranging from "most vital" to "a disappointment," although the reviewers consistently praised her use of dialect and language. This unique collection includes reviews of Mules and Men (1935), the first collection of African-American folklore published by an African American. Their Eyes Were Watching God, her 1973 novel that addressed a woman\'s desire for independence and individuality, was favorably reviewed by Alain Locke, the first Black Rhodes scholar and one of Hurston\'s professors at Howard University, and unfavorably reviewed by Richard Wright, who testily complained that the book was addressed to a white audience. The autobiographical Dust Tracks On a Road (1942) was received favorably, with comments on Hurston\'s "gutsy language." Reviews of Seraph on the Suwanne, Hurston\'s 1948 novel featuring primarily white characters, are also included, as well as those of earlier works such as Tell My Horses and Moses, Man of the Mountain. The essays presented here were published between 1982 and 1992 by academics, authors, and critics. They provide discussions and analysis, at greater length, of such factors as Hurston\'s language, characters, voice, and her ability to reflect the reality of Black women\'s lives.… (more)', 'characters': ['Zora Neale Hurston'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781567921571': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/12554536', 'Members': '347', 'Reviews': '4', 'Popularity': '56,196', 'Average rating': '(3.67)', 'Mentions': '11', 'summary': 'Two thematically-related novels by Georges Perec in one volume.

And its message is being heard: Today, entrepreneurs from Seattle to Florida are heeding the call of The Great Good Place--opening coffee houses, bookstores, community centers, bars, and other establishments and proudly acknowledging their indebtedness to this book.… (more)', 'characters': ['Jane Addams', 'Joseph Addison', 'Roger Barker', 'Junius Browne', 'Charles II, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland', 'Norm Crosby', 'Ben Davis', 'Jean Fourastie', 'Gail Fullerton', 'Fred Holmes', 'Violet Hunt', 'Jane Jacobs', 'Cara Richards', 'Arnold Rogow', 'Tibor Scitovsky', 'Henry Sedgwick', 'Georg Simmel', 'Joseph Wechsberg'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781569310199': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/21685327', 'Members': '59', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '346,721', 'Average rating': '(3.7)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': '', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781569319499': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/25484', 'Members': '444', 'Reviews': '2', 'Popularity': '42,092', 'Average rating': '(3.68)', 'Mentions': '7', 'summary': "Their Destiny was Foreordained The fate of the world is at stake in this gorgeously illustrated masterwork from the four-woman artistic team Clamp!

Scott Fitzgerald on Authorship provides Fitzgerald's public and private writings on his trade and craft. The forty-six selections in this volume construct an autobiographical account of Fitzgerald's twenty-year endeavor to maintain careers as a commercial writer and as a literary artist. Offering a clear sense of his seriousness about writing, they correct misconceptions that have impeded a proper assessment of Fitzgerald's professional authorship and distorted his reputation as a man of letters.\nIn a substantial introduction to the volume, Matthew J. Bruccoli positions Fitzgerald as a case history for the profession-of-authorship approach to American literary history formulated by William Charvat. Bruccoli notes that more is known about the professional life of Fitzgerald than about that of any other major American author, and, drawing on that wealth of information, he challenges familiar myths about Fitzgerald's squandering of fortunes and literary genius. Bruccoli exposes the error of segregating Fitzgerald's magazine and movie work from his novels, suggesting instead that a symbiotic relationship exists among these works and ties them together.\nIn his own words, Fitzgerald corrects the most condescending and irksome notion about him - that he was a literary ignoramus who wrote brilliantly without knowing what he was doing. As these letters, notebook entries, book reviews, and articles clearly indicate, Fitzgerald reached usable conclusions about the craft of writing, the discipline of authorship, and the obligations of literature.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781570614590': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/44637', 'Members': '828', 'Reviews': '25', 'Popularity': '19,563', 'Average rating': '(4.3)', 'Mentions': '10', 'summary': 'Buddhism teaches that each person must overcome 100 demons in a lifetime.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a new, scientifically based psychotherapy that takes a fresh look at why we suffer and even what it means to be mentally healthy. What if pain were a normal, unavoidable part of the human condition, but avoiding or trying to control painful experience were the cause of suffering and long-term problems that can devastate your quality of life? The ACT process hinges on this distinction between pain and suffering. As you work through this book, you'll learn to let go of your struggle against pain, assess your values, and then commit to acting in ways that further those values. ACT is not about fighting your pain; it's about developing a willingness to embrace every experience life has to offer. It's not about resisting your emotions; it's about feeling them completely and yet not turning your choices over to them. ACT offers you a path out of suffering by helping you choose to live your life based on what matters to you most. If you're struggling with anxiety, depression, or problem anger, this book can help--clinical trials suggest that ACT is very effective for a whole range of psychological problems. But this is more than a self-help book for a specific complaint--it is a revolutionary approach to living a richer and more rewarding life. Learn why the very nature of human language can cause suffering Escape the trap of avoidance Foster willingness to accept painful experience Practice mindfulness skills to achieve presence in the moment Discover the things you really value most Commit to living a vital, meaningful life This book has been awarded The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit -- an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties.

Jack Duluoz journeys from the Cascade Mountains to San Francisco, Mexico City, New York, and Tangier. While working as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the Cascades, Duluoz contemplates his inner void and the distressing isolation brought on by his youthful sense of adventure. In Tangier he suffers a similar feeling of desperation during an opium overdose, and in Mexico City he meets up with a morphine-addicted philosopher and seeks an antidote to his solitude in a whorehouse. As in Kerouac's other novels, Desolation Angels features a lively cast of pseudonymous versions of his fellow Beat poets, including William S. Burroughs (as Bull Hubbard), Neal Cassady (as Cody Pomeray), and Allen Ginsberg (as Irwin Garden). Duluoz draws readers into the trials and tribulations of these literary iconoclasts-from drug-fueled writing frenzies and alcoholic self-realizations to frenetic international road trips and tumultuous love affairs. Achieving literary success comes with its own consequences though, as Duluoz and his friends must face the scrutiny that comes with rising to the national stage.… (more)", 'characters': ['Jack Duluoz', 'Irwin Garden', 'Raphael Urso', 'Julien', 'Cody Pomeray', 'Bull Hubbard', 'Bull Gaines'], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781573225786': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/4615', 'Members': '5,153', 'Reviews': '101', 'Popularity': '1,539', 'Average rating': '(3.96)', 'Mentions': '173', 'summary': 'From the New York Times bestselling author of The Good Lord Bird, winner of the 2013 National Book Award for Fiction, and Kill \'Em and Leave, a James Brown biography. Who is Ruth McBride Jordan? A self-declared "light-skinned" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician, and son, explores his mother\'s past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man\'s Tribute to His White Mother. The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in "orchestrated chaos" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. "Mommy," a fiercely protective woman with "dark eyes full of pep and fire," herded her brood to Manhattan\'s free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades, and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother\'s footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents\' loveless marria≥ her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned. At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all- black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. "God is the color of water," Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life\'s blessings and life\'s values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth\'s determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college--and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University. Interspersed throughout his mother\'s compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self- realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son. \xa0… (more)', 'characters': ['Ruth McBride Jordan', 'James McBride', 'Rachel Deborah Shilsky', 'Ruchel Dwajra Zylska', 'Andrew Dennis McBride', 'Hunter Jordan'], 'awards_and_honors': ['Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (1997.2|Nonfiction, 1997)', 'ALA Notable Books for Adults (1997) (Book of the Year)', 'ALA Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults (1998.03|Feel Good Books, 1998)', 'ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (1999.3|Biography, 1999)', 'TLA Tayshas High School Reading List (1999|1998-1999)']}, '9781573226325': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/455644', 'Members': '75', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '277,643', 'Average rating': '(3.88)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'Fraught with physical, relational, professional, and psychological changes, midlife can be a challenging time.

Echo says it best -- with prose so simple and clear and inviting it\'s just like, as one reader put it, sitting down and having a cup of tea with Echo.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781577312093': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/80882', 'Members': '702', 'Reviews': '5', 'Popularity': '24,032', 'Average rating': '(3.91)', 'Mentions': '8', 'summary': 'Developed from a memorable series of lectures delivered in San Francisco, which included a legendary symposium at the Palace of Fine Arts with astronaut Rusty Schweickart, Joseph Campbell\'s last book explores the space age.

Not surprisingly, DeLillo treats interviews with the same care and caution. For years, he shunned them altogether. As his fiction grew in popularity, especially with White Noise, and he began to confront the historical record of our times in books such as Libra, DeLillo felt compelled to make himself available to his readers. Despite claims by interviewers about his elusiveness, he now hides in plain sight. In Conversations with Don DeLillo, the renowned author makes clear his distinctions between historical fact and his own creative leaps, especially in his masterwork, Underworld. There it seems the true events are unbelievable and imaginary ones not. Throughout long profiles and conversations-ranging from 1982 to 2001 and published in the New Yorker, the Paris Review, and Rolling Stone-DeLillo parries personal inquiries. He counters with the details of his work habits, his understanding of the novelist\'s role in the world, and his sense of our media-saturated culture. A number of interviews detail DeLillo\'s less-heralded work in the theater, from The Day Room to a recent production of Valparaiso, itself a stinging satire on the interviewing process. DeLillo also finds time to comment on his nonliterary passions, primarily the movies and baseball. Lee Harvey Oswald also inspires much extra-literary discussion, not just as the subject of Libra, but as a figure who, like the terrorists always lurking in DeLillo\'s fictions, captures our attention in ways novelists cannot. For DeLillo, a writer who eschews celebrity, the ultimate response might be the one he offered in his very first interview, paraphrasing Joyce: "Silence, exile, cunning, and so on. It\'s my nature to keep quiet about most things." Fortunately for his many readers and fans, he proves himself here to be a talker.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781578067596': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/18161899', 'Members': '22', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '810,277', 'Average rating': '(3.88)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': "Starting his career as an animator for Disney, Tim Burton made his feature film directorial debut with the visually dazzling, low-budget Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. When it became a surprise blockbuster, studios began to trust him with larger budgets and the whims of his expansive imagination. Mixing gothic horror, black comedy, and oddball whimsy, Burton's movies veer from childlike enchantment to morbid melancholy, often with the same frame. His beautifully designed and highly stylized films-including Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, and Ed Wood-are idiosyncratic, personal visions that have found commercial success. In Tim Burton: Interviews, the director discusses how animation and art design affect his work, how old horror films have deeply influenced his psyche, why so many of his protagonists are outcasts, and how he's managed to make personal films within the Hollywood system. He gives tribute to writers he's worked with, his favorite actors-including Johnny Depp and Vincent Price-and talks enthusiastically about pulp horror fiction and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. These interviews show his progression from an inarticulate young director to a contemplative and dry-witted artist over the course of twenty years. In later interviews, he opens up about being in therapy and how his childhood fantasies still affect his art. Tim Burton: Interviews reveals a man who has managed to thrive inside Hollywood while maintaining the distinctive quirks of an independent filmmaker.

Agate Nesaule, who as a youngster left Latvia under Nazi and Soviet threat, writes of envying a young Latvian girl\'s life, rich in place, language, and music.

Intended to be a direct competitor to the new generation of American fighters such as the F-15, the Su-27 was designed with outstanding range, heavy armament, and high agility. Excellent performance, handling, and serviceability have made the aircraft popular with its pilots and ground personnel alike. Equipped with an analog fly-by-wire control system, a full avionics suite, and up to 10 air-to-air missiles, the Flanker also features a rearward-facing radar between the engines, allowing it to fire at targets behind the aircraft. Outfitted with two Lyul'ka AL-31F turbofans, each 12,500 kgp (27,557 lb st) with afterburning, the Su-27's high thrust-to-weight ratio and refined aerodynamics allow superb flight characteristics at high angles of attack.

Slavitt presents a fluid, accessible, and modern version for both longtime admirers of the plays and those encountering them for the first time. Unpretentious and direct, Slavitt's translation preserves the innate verve and energy of the dramas, engaging the reader--or audience member--directly with Sophocles' great texts. Slavitt chooses to present the plays not in narrative sequence but in the order in which they were composed--Antigone, Oedipus Tyrannos, Oedipus at Colonus--thereby underscoring the fact that the story of Oedipus is one to which Sophocles returned over the course of his lifetime. This arrangement also lays bare the record of Sophocles' intellectual and artistic development. Renowned as a poet and translator, Slavitt has translated Ovid, Virgil, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Ausonius, Prudentius, Valerius Flaccus, and Bacchylides as well as works in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hebrew. In this volume he avoids personal intrusion on the texts and relies upon the theatrical machinery of the plays themselves.

"Opening on her fiftieth birthday, Erica Jong\'s midlife memoir reads like fast-paced fiction as it flashes back and forth in time to tell at last the truths at the heart of her novels. Poet, novelist, essayist, Jong has forged one of the most visible, and volatile, careers in American letters, and as a charter member of what she calls the "whiplash generation," she has had a front seat on the roller coaster American women have been riding for the past decades. Raised to be Doris Day, growing up wanting to be Gloria Steinem, now rearing daughters in the age of Princess Di and Madonna, today\'s women have had their expectations raised and dashed and raised and dashed again, as they\'ve watched themselves go in and out of style like hemlines. Now, as she and her contemporaries look for answers to the second half of their lives, Jong offers powerful, provocative insights into sex, marriage, and aging; feminism - past, present, and future; the writing life; motherhood and family; identity and love, loyalty and loss, drawn through the brilliant prism of her own experience." "In chapters such as "Fear of Fifty," "The Mad Lesbian in the Attic," "How I Got to Be the Second Sex," "How I Got to Be Jewish," "Fear of Fame," "Seducing the Muse," "Dona Juana Gets Smart," "Becoming Venetian," and "How to Get Married," Erica Jong takes readers on an impassioned, outrageous, irreverent tour de force through the sea changes that have defined a generation. From technical virginity to the sexual revolution to the AIDS pandemic; from The Feminine Mystique to "political correctness"; from monogamy to open marriage and back again; from stay-at-home moms to moms who have won the right to be eternally exhausted; from sexual secrecy to sexual openness - Jong proves yet again her unique ability to tap into the inner lives of women and the issues that matter most to them." "Fear of Fifty is an intoxicating, riveting read, free-wheeling and fun, warm, tough, and full of wisdom. Sure to be embraced by women everywhere, it is destined, like its classic predecessor Fear of Flying, to become required reading for a generation on the threshold of a new revolution."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Lewis are known around the world as the creators of Middle-earth and Narnia. But few of their readers and fans know about the complex friendship between Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Without the persistent encouragement of his friend, Tolkien would never have completed The Lord of the Rings. This great tale, along with the connected matter of The Silmarillion, would have remained merely a private hobby. Likewise, all of Lewis' fiction, after the two met at Oxford University in 1926, bears the mark of Tolkien's influence, whether in names he used or in the creation of convincing fantasy worlds. They quickly discovered their affinity--a love of language and the imagination, a wide reading in northern myth and fairy tale, a desire to write stories themselves in both poetry and prose. The quality of their literary friendship invites comparisons with those of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Cowper and John Newton, and G.K. Chesterton and Hillaire Belloc. Both Tolkien and Lewis were central figures in the informal Oxford literary circle, the Inklings. This book explores their lives, unfolding the extraordinary story of their complex friendship that lasted, with its ups and downs, until Lewis's death in 1963.

Above all, the war was marked by an unholy marriage of revolutionary terror and repressive torture. Nearly a half century has passed since this savagely fought war ended in Algeria's independence, and yet--as Alistair Horne argues in his new preface to his now-classic work of history--its repercussions continue to be felt not only in Algeria and France, but throughout the world. Indeed from today's vantage point the Algerian War looks like a full-dress rehearsal for the sort of amorphous struggle that convulsed the Balkans in the 1990s and that now ravages the Middle East, from Beirut to Baghdad--struggles in which questions of religion, nationalism, imperialism, and terrorism take on a new and increasingly lethal intensity.

The knot that ties these together is the truth that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. Jesus Christ died and rose again to forgive the treason of our souls, which have turned from savoring God to savoring self. In the cross of Christ, God rescues us from the house of mirrors and leads us out to the mountains and canyons of His majesty.

All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader\'\'s understanding of these enduring works. The Complete Sherlock Holmes comprises four novels and fifty-six short stories revolving around the world\'\'s most popular and influential fictional detective--the eccentric, arrogant, and ingenious Sherlock Holmes. He and his trusted friend, Dr. Watson, step from Holmes\'\'s comfortable quarters at 221b Baker Street into the swirling fog of Victorian London to exercise that unique combination of detailed observation, vast knowledge, and brilliant deduction. Inevitably, Holmes rescues the innocent, confounds the guilty, and solves the most perplexing puzzles known to literature. The Complete Sherlock Holmes starts with Holmes\'s first appearance, A Study in Scarle, a chilling murder novel complete with bloodstained walls and cryptic clues, followed by the baffling The Sign of Four, which introduces Holmes\'s cocaine problem and Watson\'s future wife. The story collections The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes feature such renowned tales as "A Scandal in Bohemia," "The Red-Headed League," and "The Musgrave Ritual." Tired of writing stories about Holmes, his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, killed him off at the end of "The Final Problem," the last tale in The Memoirs. But the public outcry was so great that eight years later he published the masterful The Hound of the Baskervilles, which supposedly takes place before Holmes\'s death. The separate Volume II of The Complete Sherlock Holmes collects the remaining accounts of Holmes\'\'s exploits, including "The Adventure of the Empty House," which reveals the elaborate circumstances behind Holmes\'\'s literary resurrection.

W. F. Hegel&&L/B&&R&&L/P&&R&&LP&&RWestern philosophy starts with Socrates and his student &&LSTRONG&&RPlato&&L/B&&R. By way of the dialectic that evolved between master and student, Plato invented the philosophical method of inquiry and analysis, and became the first to use a logical framework to ask--and try to answer--the eternal questions about ethics, politics, art, and life that still haunt humanity: What is virtue? What is justice? What is the ideal form of government? What is the individual''s relationship to the state? Do artists have a responsibility to society, or only to their own creative impulse? Plato explores these issues through a series of dialogues, records of supposed conversations between Socrates and other Greek aristocrats. Although Socrates is nominally the main speaker in all of them, only the earlier dialogues document his thoughts, while the latter ones present Plato''s own ideas.&&L/P&&R&&LP&&RWhat is often ignored in commentaries on Plato''s work is its unique literary form. The dialogues are neither dramas, nor stories, yet they are skillfully fashioned by means of characters, narrative events, dramatic moments, and perhaps most surprising, a great deal of humor.

Noted track writer B. K. Beckwith called Seabiscuit's career a saga because, like a Greek myth or beloved fairy tale, it is the tale of a forgotten, abused animal who was rescued, fought his way to the top of horse racing, stumbled, and then returned for a spectacular victory. First published in 1940, when Seabiscuit and all the major characters were alive, its pages sparkle with stories about the great horse: the moment when trainer Tom Smith noticed the emaciated bay in a cheap claims race at Saratoga Springs, the events that led Charles Howard to take a chance and buy the 'raced-out' three-year old colt with bad legs, and the exhilarating accounts from jockeys Red Pollard and George 'Iceman' Woolf of Seabiscuit's trademark bursts of speed. Under Smith s training and care, Seabiscuit would defeat the Triple Crown champion, War Admiral, by four lengths in the most famous match race in history. Featuring period photographs and specially commissioned artwork by Howard Brodie, Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion follows the thoroughbred's illustrious career, from his humble birth in Kentucky to his remarkable string of races across the country from 1936 to 1940, and culminating in his stunning victory at Santa Anita, a moment that confirmed Seabiscuit as one of the greatest racehorses of all time.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781594201004': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/1120185', 'Members': '1,338', 'Reviews': '13', 'Popularity': '10,408', 'Average rating': '(3.91)', 'Mentions': '5', 'summary': 'Historian Fergusson priovides a revolutionary reinterpretation of the modern era that resolves its central paradox: why unprecedented progress coincided with unprecedented violence, and why the seeming triumph of the West bore the seeds of its undoing. From the conflicts that presaged the First World War to the aftershocks of the Cold War, the twentieth century was by far the bloodiest in all of human history. How can we explain the astonishing scale and intensity of its violence when, thanks to the advances of science and economics, most people were better off than ever before? Wherever one looked, the world in 1900 offered the happy prospect of ever-greater interconnection. Why, then, did global progress descend into internecine war and genocide?

But prominent social and cultural critic Steven Johnson argues that our popular culture has never been smarter. Drawing from fields as diverse as neuroscience, economics, and literary theory, the author argues that the junk culture we're so eager to dismiss is in fact making us more intelligent. A video game will never be a book nor should it aspire to be-and, in fact, video games, from Tetris to the Sims to Grand Theft Auto, have been shown to raise IQ scores and develop cognitive abilities that can't be learned from books. Likewise, successful television, when examined closely and taken seriously, reveals surprising narrative sophistication and intellectual demands. This book is a hopeful and spirited account of contemporary culture. The author demonstrates that our culture is not declining but changing-in exciting and stimulating ways we'd do well to understand.

He was without question the greatest of the Rougons.\' His Excellency Eug�ne Rougon (1876) is the sixth novel in Zola\'s twenty-volume Rougon-Macquart cycle. A political novel set in the corridors of power and in the upper echelons of French Second Empire society, including the Imperial court, it focuses on the fluctuating fortunes of the authoritarian Eug�ne Rougon, the "vice-Emperor."

It plunges the reader into the essential dynamics of the political: the rivalries, the scheming, the jockeying for position, the ups and downs, the play of interests, the lobbying and gossip, the patronage and string-pulling, the bribery and blackmail, and, especially, the manipulation of language for political purposes. The novel\'s themes--especially its treatment of political discourse--have remarkable contemporary resonance.

M. Forster- A Passage to India A Passage to India (1924), the last of E. M. Forster's novels to be published in his lifetime, became an immediate bestseller and also met with critical acclaim for its moral and political commentary on the crossings between individuals and cultures in the India of the British Empire. Forster's record of the terrible consequences of failed connection, of the unexpected upheavals that unsettle the calm of middle-class life, and of the challenges to the ideological foundations of Empire draw their strength from the novel's blend of intense realism and complex narrative technique. In this Icon Critical Guide, Betty Jay considers the establishment of Forster's reputation and the various attempts of critics to decipher the complex codes that are a feature of his novel. Successive chapters focus on debates around Forster's liberal-humanism, with essays from F. R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling and Malcolm Bradbury; on the indeterminacy and ambiguity of the text, with extracts from essays by Gillian Beer, Robert Barratt, Wendy Moffat and Jo-Ann Hoeppner Moran; and on the sexual politics of Forster's work, with writings from Elaine Showalter, Frances L.

A war that humanity was near to losing.

The book offers an optimistic message to counteract our contemporary tendency towards pessimism and nihilism: purposeful activity will always allow us to call on our higher selves and bring concentration, control and a sense of meaning into life. Wilson uses the concept of the multi-personality to explain a wide range of paranormal phenomenon, from dowsing and demonic possession to precognition and spoon-bending, and he analyses the work of all the big names in 20th-century supra-rational research (from T C Lethbridge to Margaret Murray to Carl Jung) from this perspective.

Pressing Freudian and Saussurean categories into the service of a basically Marxist perspective, The System of Objects offers a cultural critique of the commodity in consumer society. Baudrillard classifies the everyday objects of the "new technical order" as functional, nonfunctional and metafunctional. He contrasts "modern" and "traditional" functional objects, subjecting home furnishing and interior design to a celebrated semiological analysis. His treatment of nonfunctional or "marginal" objects focuses on antiques and the psychology of collecting, while the metafunctional category extends to the useless, the aberrant and even the "schizofunctional." Finally, Baudrillard deals at length with the implications of credit and advertising for the commodification of everyday life. The System of Objects is a tour de force of the materialist semiotics of the early Baudrillard, who emerges in retrospect as something of a lightning rod for all the live ideas of the day: Bataille\'s political economy of "expenditure" and Mauss\'s theory of the gift; Reisman\'s lonely crowd and the "technological society" of Jacques Ellul; the structuralism of Roland Barthes in The System of Fashion; Henri Lefebvre\'s work on the social construction of space; and last, but not least, Guy Debord\'s situationist critique of the spectacle.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781844670550': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/124367', 'Members': '186', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '111,875', 'Average rating': '(3.5)', 'Conversations': 'None', 'summary': 'This wide-ranging book argues that criticism emerged in early bourgeois society as a central feature of a "public sphere" in which political, ethical, and literary judgements could mingle under the benign rule of reason.

Are universal values outdated relics of an earlier age? In fear of the horrors of totalitarianism should we submit ourselves to a miserable third way of economic liberalism and government-as-administration?

Examining Heidegger's seduction by fascism and Foucault's flirtation with the Iranian Revolution, he suggests that these were the 'right steps in the wrong direction.' He argues that while the revolutionary terror of Robespierre, Mao and the Bolsheviks ended in historic failure and monstrosity, this is not the whole story. There is, in fact, a redemptive moment that gets lost in the outright liberal-democratic rejection of revolutionary authoritarianism and the valorization of soft, consensual, decentralized politics. Zizek claims that, particularly in light of the forthcoming ecological crisis, we should reinvent revolutionary terror and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the struggle for universal emancipation.

Arenas, acknowledged as one of the great twentieth-century Cuban writers, was born in 1943 into a poor, rural Cuban family. At the age of fifteen he joined Castro\'s guerrillas against Batista\'s right-wing regime, only to discover that repression under Castro would be on a monumental scale. Reinaldo Arenas spent twenty years of his life trying to survive his "re-education," to safeguard his manuscripts, and to maintain his sanity when he was imprisoned in El Morro prison in Havana. But despite everything that happened to him, including betrayal by his aunt and some of his closest "friends," Arenas triumphed, finally leaving Cuba during the Mariel exodus in 1980." "But America could never replace his beloved Cuba, and his anti-Castro stance made him unsympathetic to many American intellectuals. The final irony was his battle with AIDS, which dominated the last years of his life until he committed suicide on December 7, 1990, at the age of forty-seven." "Before Night Falls was begun before Arenas left Cuba and was completed in the last stage of the disease. It is an extraordinary document - a compelling and moving account of the hell that Arenas experienced in Cuba and the purgatory he endured in the United States. It is a book both raw and fierce, tender and lyrical, particularly about the Cuban landscape. In it you will discover a man of enormous vitality, resilience, and courage. Arenas writes of his own book, "I tell my truth like a Jew who has suffered from racism, a Russian who has been in the Gulag, or any human being who has eyes to see things as they are: I cry out: therefore I am.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Born in Portsmouth, in 1812, he spent a happy childhood in Chatham, Kent, until the age of twelve, when his father was imprisoned for debt. After working as an office boy, and studying shorthand, he became a reporter for the Morning Chronicle before writing articles for numerous other periodicals. By 1836, these articles were republished in book form as Sketches by Boz. Dickens then began his career as a novelist, and continued to write until his death in 1870.

Most sensationally, his telescopes allowed him to reveal a new reality in the heavens and to reinforce the astounding argument that the Earth moves around the Sun. For this belief, he was brought before the Holy Office of the Inquisition, accused of heresy, and forced to spend his last years under house arrest." "Of Galileo\'s three illegitimate children, the eldest best mirrored his own brilliance, industry, and sensibility, and by virtue of these qualities became his confidante. Born Virginia in 1600, she was thirteen when Galileo placed her in a convent near him in Florence, where she took the most appropriate name of Suor Maria Celeste. Her loving support, which Galileo repaid in kind, proved to be her father\'s greatest source of strength throughout his most productive and tumultuous years. Her presence, through letters which Sobel has translated from their original Italian and woven into the narrative, graces her father\'s life now as it did then." "Galileo\'s Daughter dramatically recolors the personality and accomplishment of a mythic figure whose seventeenth-century clash with Catholic doctrine continues to define the schism between science and religion.

Examining a series of El Niño-induced droughts and the famines that they spawned around the globe in the last third of the 19th century, Mike Davis discloses the intimate, baleful relationship between imperial arrogance and natural incident that combined to produce some of the worst tragedies in human history. Late Victorian Holocausts focuses on three zones of drought and subsequent famine: India, Northern China; and Northeastern Brazil. All were affected by the same global climatic factors that caused massive crop failures, and all experienced brutal famines that decimated local populations. But the effects of drought were magnified in each case because of singularly destructive policies promulgated by different ruling elites. Davis argues that the seeds of underdevelopment in what later became known as the Third World were sown in this era of High Imperialism, as the price for capitalist modernization was paid in the currency of millions of peasants' lives.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['World History Association Book Prize (2002)']}, '9781859843833': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/58239', 'Members': '245', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '83,087', 'Average rating': '(4)', 'Mentions': '2', 'summary': "Many see the meeting between literature and politics as fraught.

The detailed output of individual presses and artists is set against the intensification of the nationalist struggle, the constraints imposed by colonial state censorship, and fifty years of Indian independence. The reader is introduced to artists who trained within colonial art schools, others whose skills reflect their membership of traditional painting castes, and yet others who are self-taught former sign painters.

Previously, those interested in reading or teaching these dialogues had to acquire several books, typically having introductions that portrayed Plato's philosophy as strictly anti-rhetorical. The introduction to this volume treats Plato's discussions of the language arts as central to his philosophical practice. Reflecting current critical discussions about the significance of ambiguities and inconsistencies in the dialogues, the introduction approaches them as enacting the dialogical and rhetorical practice of philosophy rather than as expositions of doctrine. Readers are thus invited to participate in the dialogues as vital philosophical conversations about issues that animate contemporary rhetorical and literary thought today. Specific features of this text include: * four key dialogues on rhetoric and language presented in one volume in complete, contemporary translations; * an introduction that discusses the complexities of Plato's dialogues and views on language, writing, dialogue, rhetoric, and poetics in a readable style; * brief introductions to each dialogue that point out the major features of the dialogue as well as raise questions to stimulate thoughtful reading; * an expanded bibliography for those interested in pursuing further critical discussion of the texts; and * an index to key terms and concepts covered in the introduction and dialogues.… (more)", 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781880656419': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/209799', 'Members': '202', 'Reviews': 'None', 'Popularity': '102,329', 'Average rating': '(3.52)', 'Mentions': '12', 'summary': 'Artist-writer-director-producer Hayao Miyazaki is often called "the Walt Disney of Japan." His animated theatrical features have been smash hits in Japan, and many, including My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki\'s Delivery Service, are already familiar to American audiences. Now, with Disney-Miramax\'s imminent release of Princess Mononoke,, Miyazaki\'s masterwork and one of the top-grossing film in all Japanese history, this "animation master" is about to take America and the world by storm. Mixing first-hand interview and personal insights with critical evaluations of art, plot, production qualities, and literary themes, McCarthy provides a film-by-film appraisal that examines technique as well as message. She reveals Miyazaki to be not just a master of the art of animation, but a meticulous craftsman who sees his work as a medium for shaping the humanistic and environmental concerns of our times. An overview of the artist and his early career is followed by in-depth examinations of seven major Miyazaki films: Nausica#65533; of the Valley of Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Castle of Cagliostro, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki\'s Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, and Princess Mononoke. Included are design and technical data, story synopses and character sketches, personnel and filmography data, and critical evaluation. Illustrations throughout, in color and black and white, show the detail and vigor of Miyazaki\'s art. Written for anime fans as well as students of film, literature, and popular culture, McCarthy\'s book raises animation criticism to a whole new level and is an essential guide to the work of a world-class filmmaker.

But it's not just any form of poker that has people across the country so excited - it's no-limit hold 'em - the main event game. And now - thanks to televised tournaments - tens of thousands of new players are eager to claim their share of poker glory. In the first volume of this series, Harrington on Hold 'em: Volume I: Strategic Play, Dan Harrington explained how to play in the early phases of tournaments, when most players at the table had plenty of chips, and the blinds and antes were small. This book, Harrington on Hold 'em: Volume II: The Endgame shows you how to play in the later phases of a tournament, when the field has been cut down, the blinds and antes are growing, and the big prize money is within sight. Harrington shows you how to make moves, handle tricky inflection point plays, and maneuver when the tournament is down to its last few players and the end is in sight. He's also included a whole chapter on heads-up play, whose strategies up to now have been a closely-guarded secret of the game's top masters. Dan Harrington won the gold bracelet and the World Champion title at the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold 'em Championship at the 1995 World Series of Poker. And he was the only player to make it to the final table in 2003 (field of 839) and 2004 (field of 2,576) - considered by cognoscenti to be the greatest accomplishment in WSOP history. In Harrington on Hold 'em, Harrington and two-time World Backgammon Champion Bill Robertie have written the definitive book on no-limit hold 'em for players who want to win - and win big.

Born into an upper-class New York family, Edith Wharton broke with convention and became a professional writer, earning an enduring place as the grande dame of American letters. This Library of America collection (along with its companion volume, Collected Stories: 1911-1937) presents the finest of Wharton\'s achievement in short fiction, drawn from the more than eighty stories she published over the course of her career. Opening with her first published story--the charming "Mrs. Manstey\'s View," about a disruption in the life of an elderly apartment-dweller--this first of two volumes presents a writer, already at the height of her powers, beginning to explore the concerns of a lifetime. In "Souls Belated," two lovers attempt to escape the consequences of their adultery--a subject to which Wharton returns throughout her career. In "The Mission of Jane" (about a remarkable adopted child) and "The Pelican" (about an itinerant lecturer), she discovers her gift for social and cultural satire. Perhaps the finest of her ghost stories, "The Eyes," with its Jamesian sense of evil, is also included, along with two novella-length works, "The Touchstone" and "Sanctuary," revealing the dazzling range of Wharton\'s fictive imagination.

The book concludes that, as thinking and caring inhabitants of a menacing world, we must all learn to hear unspeakable truths.

First published in 1998, Eureka Mill is Ron Rash's seminal collection of poetry. It introduced the world to an often overlooked Appalachian region and cemented Rash's name as synonymous with Southern writing. Eureka Mill presents a lyrical portrait of the migration of poor North Carolina farmers to Chester, South Carolina to work in the Eureka Cotton Mill in the years before the Great Depression. Drawing on his family history in the region that stretches back three hundred years, Rash assembles a nuanced tapestry of mill village life, from the foremen in their offices to the men and women at the looms toiling in the often inhumane conditions of the mills. Rash's poetry elevates the people and landscapes of rural Appalachia to incandescent heights, garnering comparisons to the work of Seamus Heaney and Robert Frost.

Long thought to be the work of over imaginative writers, the author now takes the subject beyond the void of pure speculation and into the realm of 21st Century science. For according the COMMANDER X -- a former military intelligence operative with connections to the CIA and Defense Department, on a number of occasions he witnessed the testing of highly classified super TOP SECRET black project aircraft engaged in maneuvers over Area 51 in the Nevada desert. Furthermore, the national whistle-blower claims he actually sat at the helm of one of these ships as it bio-located from one place to another...INSTANTLY What was so unusual about these flights over Area 51 is the fact that the technology being tested involved principles of teleportation gleamed from reverse engineering of alien spacecraft which have crashed to Earth. The author maintains that extraterrestrials have been trying to feed us clues regarding the existence of this interstellar mode of transport which will enable us to instantly maneuver between two points in the twinkle of an eye COMMANDER X further insists it is within the realm of possibility for the reader of this book to learn the fundamentals of teleportation and participate in experiments of their very own -- no matter how outlandish this may seem In detail, he describes his own work with the military in developing skills necessary to engage in spontaneous teleportation...skills that could very well lead you along the path to personal gratification and success. The book also delves into the impact the STAR TREK series has had on introducing the general public to what is just around the bend for our world and the possibility this is part of a grass roots campaign to inform the public on a need to know basis a little bit at a time.

The book gathers his essays and interviews to provide a short, accessible introduction to his distinctively optimistic brand of anarchism. Chomsky eloquently refutes the notion of anarchism as a fixed idea, suggesting that it is part of a living, evolving tradition, and he disputes the traditional fault lines between anarchism and socialism, emphasizing the power of collective, rather than individualist, action.

(now aha! Process, Inc.) published. It is fitting that the book and the company\'s history are intertwined. The central goal of the company is educating people about the differences that separate economic classes and then teaching them skills to bridge those gulfs. Framework is the method that delivers that message. Ruby\'s thesis for Framework is simple. Individuals accustomed to personal poverty think and act differently from people in the middle and upper economic classes. Most teachers today come from middle-class backgrounds. Economic class differences, in an educational setting, often make both teaching and learning challenging. Too often, teachers don\'t understand why a student from poverty is chronically acting out or is not grasping a concept even after repeated explanations. At the same time, the student doesn\'t understand what he/she is expected to produce and why. Ruby discusses at length the social cues or "hidden rules" that govern how we think and interact in society - and the significance of those rules in a classroom. Framework also illuminates differences between generational poverty and situational poverty. Ruby explains the "voices" that all of us use to project ourselves to the outside world and how poverty can affect those voices. Through the use of realistic teaching scenarios, Ruby focuses attention on sources of support, or resources, which might or might not be present in a student\'s life. Resources are important assets - things like mental stability, emotional support, and physical health - and the more resources students have in their lives, the better able they\'ll be to achieve their goals. Framework is a teacher\'s book. It draws on years of experience in multiple school systems, along with a wide range of academic positions. In this groundbreaking work Ruby Payne matter-of-factly presents the issues central to teaching students from poverty, then takes a pivotal next step by offering proven tools educators can use immediately to improve the quality of instruction in their classrooms.… (more)', 'characters': [''], 'awards_and_honors': ['']}, '9781929241637': {'library_thing_url': 'https://www.librarything.com/work/359436', 'Members': '140', 'Reviews': '3', 'Popularity': '150,295', 'Average rating': '(3.89)', 'Mentions': '14', 'summary': 'He called her my beloved esposa because Anna was his dearest love on this earth.

We cannot quote Shakespeare to describe a headache. We must, Woolf says, invent language to describe pain. And though illness enhances our perceptions, she observes that it reduces self-consciousness; it is "the great confessional." Woolf discusses the cultural taboosassociated with illness and explores how illness changes the way we read. Poems clarify and astonish, Shakespeare exudes new brilliance, and so does melodramatic fiction! On Being Ill was published as an individual volume by Hogarth Press in 1930. While other Woolf essays, such as A Room of One\'s Own and Three Guineas, were first published by Hogarth as individual volumes and have since been widely available , On Being Ill has been overlooked.

Together they mark the beginning of the brilliant period in the novelist\'s career known as the late phase. "The Other House" (1896) shows James incorporating an act of murder into the heart of his narrative. Long neglected, the novel is a fascinating glimpse into a very different side of Henry James, as he explores the violent implications of jealousy and possessiveness. In "The Spoils of Poynton" (1897), the artworks conserved in the manor house of the title become the object of a protracted power struggle between the mother and the fiance of the heir to the house. The struggle, in this most tightly constructed of James\'s late novels, hinges ultimately on the sensitivities of a third woman. "What Maisie Knew" (1897) recounts the aftermath of a divorce through the eyes of the couple\'s daughter. James adopts what he described as "the consciousness, the dim, sweet, scared, wondering, clinging perception of the child." Similarly experimental, "The Awkward Age" (1899) maps the interrelations of a large cast of characters, a group of old friends and their children, almost entirely through dialogue.

Writing to his friend William Dean Howells, James characterized\xa0The Sacred Fount, the only one of his novels to be told in the first person, as "a fine flight into the high fantastic." While traveling to the country house of Newmarch for a weekend party, the nameless narrator becomes obsessed with the idea that a person may become younger or cleverer by tapping the "sacred fount" of another person. Convinced that Grace Brissenden has become younger by drawing upon her husband, Guy, the narrator seeks to discover the source of the newfound wit of Gilbert Long, previously "a fine piece of human furniture." His perplexing and ambiguous quest, and the varying reactions it provokes from the other guests, calls into question the imaginative inquiry central to James\'s art of the novel. James described the essential idea of\xa0The Wings of the Dove\xa0as "a young person conscious of a great capacity for life, but early stricken and doomed, condemned to die under short respite, while also enamoured of the world." The heroine, a wealthy young American heiress, Milly Theale (inspired by James\'s beloved cousin Minny Temple), is slowly drawn into a trap set for her by the English adventuress Kate Croy and her lover, the journalist Morton Densher. The unexpected outcome of their mercenary scheme provides the resolution to a tragic story of love and betrayal, innocence and experience that has long been acknowledged as one of James\'s supreme achievements as a novelist.
